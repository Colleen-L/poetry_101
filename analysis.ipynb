Some one came riding like mad\\nOver the bridge and up the road--Farmer Rouf\\'s little lad.\\nBareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped to say,\\n\"Morgan\\'s men are coming, Frau; they\\'re galloping on this way.\\n\\n\"I\\'m sent to warn the neighbors. He isn\\'t a mile behind;\\nHe sweeps up all the horses--every horse that he can find.\\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan\\'s terrible men,\\nWith bowie knives and pistols, are galloping up the glen!\"\\n\\nThe lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the door;\\nThe baby laughed and prattled, playing with spools on the floor;\\nKentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was gone.\\nNearer, nearer, Morgan\\'s men were galloping, galloping on!\\n\\nSudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture bar.\\n\"Kentuck!\" I called--\"Kentucky!\" She knew me ever so far!\\nI led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,\\nAnd tied her to the bushes; her head was just out of sight.\\n\\nAs I ran back to the log house, at once there came a sound--\\nThe ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the ground--\\nComing into the turnpike out from the White Woman Glen--\\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan\\'s terrible men.\\n\\nAs near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in alarm;\\nBut still I stood in the doorway with baby on my arm.\\nThey came, they passed; with spur and whip in haste they sped along--\\nMorgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred strong.\\n\\nWeary they looked and jaded, riding through night and through day;\\nPushing on east to the river, many long miles away,\\nTo the border strip where Virginia runs up into the West,\\nAnd fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.\\n\\nOn like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in advance;\\nBright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a sideways glance.\\nAnd I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,\\nWhen the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.\\n\\nFrightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in his face,\\nAs he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around the place.\\nI gave him a cup, and he smiled--\\'twas only a boy, you see;\\nFaint and worn, with dim blue eyes; and he\\'d sailed on the Tennessee.\\n\\nOnly sixteen he was, sir--a fond mother\\'s only son--\\nOff and away with Morgan before his life had begun!\\nThe damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the boyish mouth;\\nAnd I thought me of the mother waiting down in the South.\\n\\nOh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through and through;\\nBoasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words wouldn\\'t do;--\\nThe boy was dying, sir, dying as plain as plain could be,\\nWorn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Tennessee.\\n\\nBut when I told the laddie that I too was from the South,\\nWater came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his mouth.\\n\"Do you know the Blue-Grass country?\" he wistful began to say;\\nThen swayed like a willow sapling, and fainted dead away.\\n\\nI had him into the log house, and worked and brought him to;\\nI fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother\\'d do;\\nAnd when the lad got better, and the noise in his head was gone,\\nMorgan\\'s men--were miles; away, galloping, galloping on.\\n\\n\"Oh, I must go,\" he muttered; \"I must be up and away!\\nMorgan--Morgan is waiting for me; Oh, what will Morgan say?\"\\nBut I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door--\\nThe ringing sound of horses\\' hoofs that I had heard before.\\n\\nAnd on, on, came the soldiers--the Michigan cavalry--\\nAnd fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping rapidly,--\\nThey had followed hard on Morgan\\'s track; they had followed day and night;\\nBut of Morgan and Morgan\\'s raiders they had never caught a sight.\\n\\nAnd rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer days;\\nFor strange, wild men were galloping over her broad highways--\\nNow here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north, now east, now west,\\nThrough river-valleys and cornland farms, sweeping away her best.\\n\\nA bold ride and a long ride; but they were taken at last.\\nThey almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;\\nBut the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford,\\nAnd Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible sword.\\n\\nWell, I kept the boy till evening--kept him against his will--\\nBut he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and still.\\nWhen it was cool and dusky--you\\'ll wonder to hear me tell--\\nBut I stole down to that gully, and brought up Kentucky Belle.\\n\\nI kissed the star on her forehead--my pretty gentle lass--\\nBut I knew that she\\'d be happy back in the old Blue-Grass.\\nA suit of clothes of Conrad\\'s, with all the money I had,\\nAnd Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out lad.\\n\\nI guided him to the southward as well as I know how;\\nThe boy rode off with many thanks, and many a backward bow;\\nAnd then the glow it faded, and my heart began to swell,\\nAs down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky Belle!\\n\\nWhen Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shining high;\\nBaby and I were both crying--I couldn\\'t tell him why--\\nBut a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall,\\nAnd a thin old horse, with drooping head, stood in Kentucky\\'s stall.\\n\\nWell, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to me;\\nHe knew I couldn\\'t help it--\\'twas all for the Tennessee,\\nBut, after the war was over, just think what came to pass--\\nA letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old Blue-Grass.\\n\\nThe lad had got across the border, riding Kentucky Belle;\\nAnd Kentuck, she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and well;\\nHe cared for her, and kept her, nor touched her with whip or spur.\\nAh! we\\'ve had many horses since, but never a horse like her!\\n\\n    _Constance F.

I couldn\\'t blame the man,\\n  The foreman there at the factory, for losing faith in Joe,\\nFor his mind was never upon his work, but on some invention-plan,\\n  As with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro.\\n\\nYet, he kept on workin\\' at various things, till our little money went\\n  For wheels and screws and metal casts and things I had never seen;\\nAnd I ceased to ask, \"Any pay, my dear?\" with the answer, \"Not a cent!\"\\n  When his lock and his patent-saw had failed, he clung to that great\\n          machine.\\n\\nI remember one special thing that year. He had bought some costly tool,\\n  When we wanted our boy to learn to read--he was five years old, you\\n          know;\\nHe went to his class with cold, bare feet, till at last he came from\\n          school\\n  And gravely said, \"Don\\'t send me back; the children tease me so!\"\\n\\nI hadn\\'t the heart to cross the child, so, while I sat and sewed\\n  He would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side;\\nAnd when the struggle was hardest and I felt keen hunger\\'s goad\\n  Driving me almost to despair--the little baby died.\\n\\nHer father came to the cradle-side, as she lay, so small and white;\\n  \"Maggie,\" he said, \"I have killed this child, and now I am killing you!\\nI swear by heaven, I will give it up!\" Yet, like a thief, that night\\n  He stole to the shop and worked; his brow all wet with a clammy dew.\\n\\nI cannot tell how I lived that week, my little boy and I,\\n  Too proud to beg; too weak to work; and the weather cold and wild.\\nI can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky,\\n  And the wind went wailing round the house, like the ghost of my buried\\n          child.\\n\\nJoe still toiled in the little shop. Somebody clicked the gate;\\n  A neighbor-lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor,\\nBut I sat half-stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate,\\n  Till I heard--the crack of a pistol-shot; and I sprang to the workshop\\n          door.\\n\\nThat door was locked and the bolt shut fast. I could not cry, nor speak,\\n  But I snatched my boy from the corner there, sick with a sudden dread,\\nAnd carried him out through the garden plot, forgetting my arms were weak,\\n  Forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head;\\n\\nThe front door yielded to my touch. I staggered faintly in,\\n  Fearing--_what_? He stood unharmed, though the wall showed a\\n          jagged hole.\\nIn his trembling hand, his aim had failed, and the great and deadly sin\\n  Of his own life\\'s blood was not yet laid on the poor man\\'s tortured soul.\\n\\nBut the pistol held another charge, I knew; and like something mad\\n  I shook my fist in my poor man\\'s face, and shrieked at him, fierce and\\n          wild,\\n\"How can you dare to rob us so?\"--and I seized the little lad;\\n  \"How can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child?\"\\n\\nAll of a sudden, he bowed his head, while from his nerveless hand\\n  That hung so limp, I almost feared to see the pistol fall.\\n\"Maggie,\" he said in a low, low voice, \"you see me as I stand\\n  A hopeless man. My plan has failed. That letter tells you all.\"\\n\\nThen for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death;\\n  Only the drip of the rain outside, for the storm was almost o\\'er;\\nBut no;--there followed another sound, and I started, caught my breath;\\n  As a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door.\\n\\nI shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise;\\n  He must have guessed our awful state; he couldn\\'t help but see\\nThere was something wrong; but never a word, never a look in his eyes\\n  Told what he thought, as in kindly way he talked to Joe and me.\\n\\nHe was come from a thriving city firm, and they\\'d sent him here to say\\n  That _one_ of Joe\\'s inventions was a great, successful thing;\\nAnd which do you think? His window-catch that he\\'d tinkered up one day;\\n  And we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring.\\n\\nAnd then the pleasant stranger went, and we wakened as from a dream.\\n  My man bent down his head and said, \"Little woman, you\\'ve saved my life!\"\\nThe worn look gone from his dear gray eyes, and in its place, a gleam\\n  From the sun that has shone so brightly

Beached from behind his back, a trigger prest--\\nAnd those perplexed and patient eyes were dim,\\n  Those gaunt, long-laboring limbs were laid to rest!\\n\\nThe words of mercy were upon his lips,\\n  Forgiveness in his heart and on his pen,\\nWhen this vile murderer brought swift eclipse\\n  To thoughts of peace on earth, goodwill to men.\\n\\nThe Old World and the New, from sea to sea,\\n  Utter

raising\\n  Just staid till the job was well done;\\nAnd as soon as his money was paid him\\n  Had shouldered his axe and had gone.\\n\\nWell, husband just kissed me and started--\\n  I could scarcely suppress a deep groan\\nAt the thought of remaining with baby\\n  So long in the house alone;\\nFor, my dear, I was childish and timid,\\n  And braver ones might well have feared,\\nFor the wild wolf was often heard howling.\\n  And savages sometimes appeared.\\n\\nBut I smothered my grief and my terror\\n  Till husband was off on his ride,\\nAnd then in my arms I took Josey,\\n  And all the day long sat and cried,\\nAs I thought of the long, dreary hours\\n  When the darkness of night should fall,\\nAnd I was so utterly helpless,\\n  With no one in reach of my call.\\n\\nAnd when the night came with its terrors,\\n  To hide ev\\'ry ray of light,\\nI hung up a quilt by the window,\\n  And, almost dead with affright,\\nI kneeled by the side of the cradle,\\n  Scarce daring to draw a full breath,\\nLest the baby should wake, and its crying\\n  Should bring us a horrible death.\\n\\nThere I knelt until late in the evening\\n  And scarcely an inch had I stirred,\\nWhen suddenly, far in the distance,\\n  A sound as of whistling I heard.\\nI started up dreadfully frightened,\\n  For fear \\'twas an Indian\\'s call;\\nAnd then very soon I remembered\\n  The red man ne\\'er whistles at all.\\n\\nAnd when I was sure \\'twas a white man,\\n  I thought, were he coming for ill,\\nHe\\'d surely approach with more caution--\\n  Would come without warning, and still.\\nThen the sound, coming nearer and nearer,\\n  Took the form of a tune light and gay,\\nAnd I knew I needn\\'t fear evil\\n  From one who could whistle that way.\\n\\nVery soon I heard footsteps approaching,\\n  Then came a peculiar dull thump,\\nAs if some one was heavily striking\\n  An ax in the top of a stump;\\nAnd then, in another brief moment,\\n  There came a light tap on the door,\\nWhen quickly I undid the fast\\'ning,\\n  And in stepped a boy, and before\\n\\nThere was either a question or answer\\n  Or either had time to speak,\\nI just threw my glad arms around him,\\n  And gave him a kiss on the cheek.\\nThen I started back, scared at my boldness.\\n  But he only smiled at my fright,\\nAs he said, \"I\\'m your neighbor\\'s boy, Ellick,\\n  Come to tarry with you through the night.\\n\\n\"We saw your husband go eastward,\\n  And made up our minds where he\\'d gone,\\nAnd I said to the rest of our people,\\n  \\'That woman is there all alone,\\nAnd I venture she\\'s awfully lonesome,\\n  And though she may have no great fear,\\nI think she would feel a bit safer\\n  If only a boy were but near.\\'\\n\\n\"So, taking my axe on my shoulder,\\n  For fear that a savage might stray\\nAcross my path and need scalping,\\n  I started right down this way;\\nAnd coming in sight of the cabin,\\n  And thinking to save you alarm,\\nI whistled a tune, just to show you\\n  I didn\\'t intend any harm.\\n\\n\"And so here I am, at your service;\\n  But if you don\\'t want me to stay,\\nWhy, all you need do is to say so,\\n  And should\\'ring my axe, I\\'ll away.\"\\nI dropped in a chair and near fainted,\\n  Just at thought of his leaving me then,\\nAnd his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle\\n  As he said, \"I guess I\\'ll remain.\"\\n\\nAnd then I just sat there and told him\\n  How terribly frightened I\\'d been,\\nHow his face was to me the most welcome\\n  Of any I ever had seen;\\nAnd then I lay down with the baby,\\n  And slept all the blessed night through,\\nFor I felt I was safe from all danger\\n  Near so brave a young fellow, and true.\\n\\nSo now, my dear friend, do you wonder,\\n  Since such a good reason I\\'ve given,\\nWhy I say I sha\\'n\\'t care for the music,\\n  Unless there is whistling in heaven?\\nYes, often I\\'ve said so in earnest,\\n  And now what I\\'ve said I repeat,\\nThat unless there\\'s a boy there a-whistling,\\n  Its music will not be complete.', \"Sleep, Baby, Sleep\\n\\n\\n      Sleep, baby, sleep!\\nThy father's watching the sheep,\\nThy mother's shaking the dreamland tree,\\nAnd down drops a little dream for thee.\\n

all,\\n    The whited wall,\\n  And the floor, and the roof o\\'erhead.\\nFor one brief moment, heedless\\n  Of the babe upon her knee,\\n    With the frenzied start\\n    Of a frightened heart,\\n  Upon her feet rose she.\\n\\nAnd through the quaint old casement\\n  She looks upon the sea;\\n    Thank God that the sight\\n    She saw that night\\n  So rare a sight should be!\\nHemmed in by many a billow\\n  With mad and foaming lip,\\n    A mile from shore,\\n    Or hardly more,\\n  She saw a gallant ship.\\n\\nAnd to her horror she beheld it\\n  Aflame from stem to stern;\\n    For there seemed no speck\\n    On all that wreck\\n  Where the fierce fire did not burn;\\nTill the night was like a sunset,\\n  And the sea like a sea of blood,\\n    And the rocks and shore\\n    Were bathed all o\\'er\\n  And drenched with the gory flood.\\n\\nShe looked and looked, till the terror\\n  Went creeping through every limb;\\n    And her breath came quick,\\n    And her heart grew sick,\\n  And her sight grew dizzy and dim;\\nAnd her lips had lost their utterance,\\n  For she tried but could not speak;\\n    And her feelings found\\n    No channel of sound\\n  In prayer, or sob, or shriek.\\n\\nOnce more that cry of anguish\\n  Thrilled through the tempest\\'s strife,\\n    And it stirred again\\n    In heart and brain\\n  The active thinking life;\\nAnd the light of an inspiration\\n  Leaped to her brightened eye,\\n    And on lip and brow\\n    Was written now\\n  A purpose pure and high.\\n\\nSwiftly she turns, and softly\\n  She crosses the chamber floor,\\n    And faltering not,\\n    In his tiny cot\\n  She laid the babe she bore.\\nAnd then with a holy impulse,\\n  She sank to her knees, and made\\n    A lowly prayer,\\n    In the silence there,\\n  And this was the prayer she prayed:\\n\\n\"O Christ, who didst bear the scourging,\\n  And who now dost wear the crown,\\n    I at Thy feet,\\n    O True and Sweet,\\n  Would lay my burden down.\\nThou bad\\'st me love and cherish\\n  The babe Thou gavest me,\\n    And I have kept\\n    Thy word, nor stept\\n  Aside from following Thee.\\n\\n\"And lo! my boy is dying!\\n  And vain is all my care;\\n    And my burden\\'s weight\\n    Is very great,\\n  Yea, greater than I can bear!\\nO Lord, Thou know\\'st what peril\\n  Doth threat these poor men\\'s lives,\\n    And I, a woman,\\n    Most weak

cruel winter wave.\\nTake Thou my babe and watch it,\\n  No care is like to Thine;\\n    And let Thy power\\n    In this perilous hour\\n  Supply what lack is mine.\"\\n\\nAnd so her prayer she ended,\\n  And rising to her feet,\\n    Gave one long look\\n    At the cradle nook\\n  Where the child\\'s faint pulses beat;\\nAnd then with softest footsteps\\n  Retrod the chamber floor,\\n    And noiselessly groped\\n    For the latch, and oped,\\n  And crossed the cottage door.\\n\\nAnd through the tempest bravely\\n  Jane Conquest fought her way,\\n    By snowy deep\\n    And slippery steep\\n  To where her duty lay.\\nAnd she journeyed onward, breathless,\\n  And weary and sore and faint,\\n    Yet forward pressed\\n    With the strength, and the zest,\\n  And the ardor of a saint.\\n\\nSolemn, and weird, and lonely\\n  Amid its countless graves,\\n    Stood the old gray church\\n    On its tall rock perch,\\n  Secure from the sea and its waves;\\nAnd beneath its sacred shadow\\n  Lay the hamlet safe and still;\\n    For however the sea\\n    And the wind might be,\\n  There was quiet under the hill.\\n\\nJane Conquest reached the churchyard,\\n  And stood by the old church door,\\n    But the oak was tough\\n    And had bolts enough,\\n  And her strength was frail and poor;\\nSo she crept through a narrow window,\\n  And climbed the belfry stair,\\n    And

but an inning left to play;\\nSo, when Cooney died at second, and Burrows did the same,\\nA pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game.\\n\\nA straggling few got up to go, leaving there the rest,\\nWith that hope which springs eternal within the human breast,\\nFor they thought: \"If only Casey could get a whack at that,\"\\nThey\\'d put up even money now, with Casey at the bat.\\n\\nBut Flynn preceded Casey, and likewise so did Blake,\\nAnd the former was a puddin\\', and the latter was a fake;\\nSo on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat.\\nFor there seemed but little chance of Casey\\'s getting to the bat,\\n\\nBut Flynn let drive a \"single,\" to the wonderment of all,\\nAnd the much-despised Blakey \"tore the cover off the ball\";\\nAnd when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred,\\nThere was Blakey safe at second, and Flynn a-huggin\\' third.\\n\\nThen, from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell,\\nIt rumbled in the mountain-tops, it rattled in the dell;\\nIt struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat;\\nFor Casey, mighty Casey, was advancing to the bat.\\n\\nThere was ease in Casey\\'s manner as he stepped into his place,\\nThere was pride in Casey\\'s bearing, and a smile on Casey\\'s face.\\nAnd when, responding to the cheers, he lightly doffed his hat,\\nNo stranger in the crowd could doubt \\'twas Casey at the bat.\\n\\nTen thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt,\\nFive thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt;\\nThen while the New York pitcher ground the ball into his hip,\\nDefiance gleamed in Casey\\'s eye, a sneer curled Casey\\'s lip.\\n\\nAnd now the leather-covered sphere came hurtling through the air,\\nAnd Casey stood a-watching it in  haughty grandeur there.\\nClose by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped--\\n\"That ain\\'t my style,\" said Casey. \"Strike one,\" the umpire said.\\n\\nFrom the benches, black with people, there went up a muffled roar,\\nLike the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore.\\n\"Kill him! Kill the umpire!\" shouted someone on the stand.\\nAnd it\\'s likely they\\'d have killed him had not Casey raised a hand.\\n\\nWith a smile of Christian charity great Casey\\'s visage shone;\\nHe stilled the rising tumult; he bade the game go on;\\nHe signaled to Sir Timothy, once more the spheroid flew;\\nBut Casey still ignored it, and the umpire said, \"Strike two.\"\\n\\n\"Fraud,\" cried the maddened thousands, and echo answered \"Fraud!\"\\nBut one scornful look from Casey and the audience was awed.\\nThey saw his face grow stern and cold, they saw his muscles strain,\\nAnd they knew that Casey wouldn\\'t let that ball go by again.\\n\\nThe sneer is gone from Casey\\'s lip, his teeth are clenched in hate;\\nHe pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate;\\nAnd now the pitcher holds the ball, and now he lets it go,\\nAnd now the air is shattered by the force of Casey\\'s blow.\\n\\nOh, somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright;\\nThe band is playing somewhere, and somewhere hearts are light;\\nAnd somewhere men are laughing, and somewhere children shout:\\nBut there is no joy in Mudville--mighty Casey has struck out.\\n\\n    _Phineas Thayer._', 'Casey\\'s Revenge\\n\\n_(Being a reply to \"Casey at the Bat.\")_\\n\\n\\nThere were saddened hearts in Mudville for a week or even more;\\nThere were muttered oaths and curses--every fan in town was sore.\\n\"Just think,\" said one, \"how soft it looked with Casey at the bat!\\nAnd then to think he\\'d go and spring a bush league trick like that.\"\\n\\nAll his past fame was forgotten; he was now a hopeless \"shine.\"\\nThey called him \"Strike-out Casey\" from the mayor down the line.\\nAnd as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh,\\nWhile a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty Casey\\'s eye.\\n\\nThe lane is long, someone has said, that never turns again,\\nAnd Fate, though fickle, often gives another chance to men.\\nAnd Casey smiled--his rugged face no longer wore a frown;\\nThe pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town.\\n\\nAll Mudville has assembled; ten thousand fans had come\\nTo see the twirler who had put big Casey on the bum;\\nAnd when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild.\\nHe doffed his cap in proud disdain--but Casey only smiled.\\n\\n\"Play ball!\" the umpire\\'s voice rang out, and then the game began;\\nBut in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan\\nWho thought that Mudville had a chance; and with the setting sun\\nTheir hopes sank low--the rival team was leading \"four to one.\"\\n\\nThe last half of the ninth came round, with no change in the score;\\nBut when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar.\\nThe din increased, the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard\\nWhen the pitcher hit the second and gave \"four balls\" to the third.\\n\\nThree men on base--nobody out--three runs to tie the game!\\nA triple meant the highest niche in Mudville\\'s hall of fame.\\nBut here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night\\nWhen the fourth one \"fouled to catcher,\" and the fifth \"flew out to right.\"\\n\\nA dismal groan in chorus came--a scowl was on each face--\\nWhen Casey walked up, bat in hand, and slowly took his place;\\nHis bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed; his teeth were clinched in hate;\\nHe gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate.\\n\\nBut fame is fleeting as the wind, and glory fades away;\\nThere were no wild and woolly cheers, no glad acclaim this day.\\nThey hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored, \"Strike him out!\"\\nBut Casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout.\\n\\nThe pitcher smiled and cut one loose; across the plate it spread;\\nAnother hiss, another groan--\"Strike one!\" the umpire said.\\nZip! Like a shot, the second curve broke just below his knee--\\n\"Strike two!\" the umpire roared aloud; but Casey made no plea.\\n\\nNo roasting for the umpire now--his was an easy lot.\\nBut here the pitcher twirled again--was that a rifle shot?\\nA whack; a crack; and out through space the leather pellet flew--\\nA blot against the distant sky, a speck against the blue.\\n\\nAbove the fence in center field, in rapid whirling flight\\nThe sphere sailed on; the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight.\\nTen thousand hats were thrown in air, ten thousand threw a fit;\\nBut no one ever found the ball that mighty Casey hit!\\n\\nOh, somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun,\\nAnd somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun;\\nAnd somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall,\\nBut Mudville hearts are happy now--for Casey hit the ball!\\n\\n    _James Wilson._', \"Rock Me to Sleep\\n\\n\\nBackward, turn backward, O time, in your flight,\\nMake me a child again just for tonight!\\nMother, come back from the echoless shore,\\nTake me again to your heart as of yore;\\nKiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\\nSmooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\\nOver my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\nBackward, flow backward, O tide of the years!\\nI am so weary of toil and of tears,--\\nToil without recompense, tears all in vain,--\\nTake them, and give me my childhood again!\\nI have grown weary of dust and decay,--\\nWeary of flinging my soul-wealth away;\\nWeary of sowing for others to reap;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\nTired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\\nMother, O mother, my heart calls for you!\\nMany a summer the grass has grown green,\\nBlossomed and faded, our faces between;\\nYet with strong yearning and passionate pain\\nLong I to-night for your presence again.\\nCome from the silence so long and so deep;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\nOver my heart, in the days that are flown,\\nNo love like mother-love ever has shone;\\nNo other worship abides and endures--\\nFaithful, unselfish and patient, like yours;\\nNone like a mother can charm away pain\\nFrom the sick soul and the world-weary brain.\\nSlumber's soft calms o'er my heavy lids creep;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\nCome, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\\nFall on your shoulders again as of old;\\nLet it drop over my forehead to-night,\\nShading my faint eyes away from the light;\\nFor with its sunny-edged shadows once more\\nHaply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\\nLovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\nMother, dear mother, the years have been long\\nSince I last listened your lullaby song;\\nSing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\\nWomanhood's years have been only a dream.\\nClasped to your breast in a loving embrace,\\nWith your light lashes just sweeping my face,\\nNever hereafter to wake or to weep;--\\nRock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep.\\n\\n    _Elizabeth Akers Allen._\", 'An Answer to \"Rock Me to Sleep\"\\n\\n\\nMy child, ah, my child;

lived alone.\\nSafe were the two, with their frugal store,\\nFrom all of the many who passed their door;\\nFor Jennie\\'s mother was strange to fears,\\nAnd Jennie was large for fifteen years;\\nWith vim her eyes were glistening,\\nHer hair was the hue of a blackbird\\'s wing;\\nAnd while the friends who knew her well\\nThe sweetness of her heart could tell,\\nA gun that hung on the kitchen wall\\nLooked solemnly quick to heed her call;\\nAnd they who were evil-minded knew\\nHer nerve was strong and her aim was true.\\nSo all kind words and acts did deal\\nTo generous, black-eyed Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nOne night, when the sun had crept to bed,\\nAnd rain-clouds lingered overhead,\\nAnd sent their surly drops for proof\\nTo drum a tune on the cottage roof,\\nClose after a knock at the outer door\\nThere entered a dozen dragoons or more.\\nTheir red coats, stained by the muddy road,\\nThat they were British soldiers showed;\\nThe captain his hostess bent to greet,\\nSaying, \"Madam, please give us a bit to eat;\\nWe will pay you well, and, if may be,\\nThis bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea;\\nThen we must dash ten miles ahead,\\nTo catch a rebel colonel abed.\\nHe is visiting home, as doth appear;\\nWe will make his pleasure cost him dear.\"\\nAnd they fell on the hasty supper with zeal,\\nClose-watched the while by Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nFor the gray-haired colonel they hovered near\\nHad been her true friend, kind and dear;\\nAnd oft, in her younger days, had he\\nRight proudly perched her upon his knee,\\nAnd told her stories many a one\\nConcerning the French war lately done.\\nAnd oft together the two friends were,\\nAnd many the arts he had taught to her;\\nShe had hunted by his fatherly side,\\nHe had shown her how to fence and ride;\\nAnd once had said, \"The time may be,\\nYour skill and courage may stand by me.\"\\nSo sorrow for him she could but feel,\\nBrave, grateful-hearted Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nWith never a thought or a moment more,\\nBare-headed she slipped from the cottage door,\\nRan out where the horses were left to feed,\\nUnhitched and mounted the captain\\'s steed,\\nAnd down the hilly and rock-strewn way\\nShe urged the fiery horse of gray.\\nAround her slender and cloakless form\\nPattered and moaned the ceaseless storm;\\nSecure and tight a gloveless hand\\nGrasped the reins with stern command;\\nAnd full and black her long hair streamed,\\nWhenever the ragged lightning gleamed.\\nAnd on she rushed for the colonel\\'s weal,\\nBrave, lioness-hearted Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nHark! from the hills, a moment mute,\\nCame a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit;\\nAnd a cry from the foremost trooper said,\\n\"Halt! or your blood be on your head\";\\nShe heeded it not, and not in vain\\nShe lashed the horse with the bridle-rein.\\n\\nSo into the night the gray horse strode;\\nHis shoes hewed fire from the rocky road;\\nAnd the high-born courage that never dies\\nFlashed from his rider\\'s coal-black eyes.\\nThe pebbles flew from the fearful race:\\nThe raindrops grasped at her glowing face.\\n\"On, on, brave beast!\" with loud appeal,\\nCried eager, resolute Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\n\"Halt!\" once more came the voice of dread;\\n\"Halt! or your blood be on your head!\"\\nThen, no one answering to the calls,\\nSped after her a volley of balls.\\nThey passed her in her rapid flight,\\nThey screamed to her left, they screamed to her right;\\nBut, rushing still o\\'er the slippery track,\\nShe sent no token of answer back,\\nExcept a silvery laughter-peal,\\nBrave, merry-hearted Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nSo on she rushed, at her own good will,\\nThrough wood and valley, o\\'er plain and hill;\\nThe gray horse did his duty well,\\nTill all at once he stumbled and fell,\\nHimself escaping the nets of harm,\\nBut flinging the girl with a broken arm.\\nStill undismayed by the numbing pain,\\nShe clung to the horse\\'s bridle-rein\\nAnd gently bidding him to stand,\\nPetted him with her able hand;\\nThen sprung again to the saddle bow,\\nAnd shouted, \"One more trial now!\"\\nAs if ashamed of the heedless fall,\\nHe gathered his strength once more for all,\\nAnd, galloping down a hillside steep,\\nGained on the troopers at every leap;\\nNo more the high-bred steed did reel,\\nBut ran his best for Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nThey were a furlong behind, or more,\\nWhen the girl burst through the colonel\\'s door,\\nHer poor arm helpless hanging with pain,\\nAnd she all drabbled and drenched with rain,\\nBut her cheeks as red as fire-brands are,\\nAnd her eyes as bright as a blazing star,\\nAnd shouted, \"Quick! be quick, I say!\\nThey come! they come! Away! away!\"\\nThen, sunk on the rude white floor of deal,\\nPoor, brave, exhausted Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\nThe startled colonel sprung, and pressed\\nThe wife and children to his breast,\\nAnd turned away from his fireside bright,\\nAnd glided into the stormy night;\\nThen soon and safely made his way\\nTo where the patriot army lay.\\nBut first he bent in the dim firelight,\\nAnd kissed the forehead broad and white,\\nAnd blessed the girl who had ridden so well\\nTo keep him out of a prison-cell.\\nThe girl roused up at the martial din,\\nJust as the troopers came rushing in,\\nAnd laughed, e\\'en in the midst of a moan,\\nSaying, \"Good sirs, your bird has flown.\\n\\'Tis I who have scared him from his nest;\\nSo deal with me now as you think best.\"\\nBut the grand young captain bowed, and said,\\n\"Never you hold a moment\\'s dread.\\nOf womankind I must crown you queen;\\nSo brave a girl I have never seen.\\nWear this gold ring as your valor\\'s due;\\nAnd when peace comes I will come for you.\"\\nBut Jennie\\'s face an arch smile wore,\\nAs she said, \"There\\'s a lad in Putnam\\'s corps,\\nWho told me the same, long time ago;\\nYou two would never agree, I know.\\nI promised my love to be as true as steel,\"\\nSaid good, sure-hearted Jennie M\\'Neal.\\n\\n    _Will Carleton._', \"The Hand That Rules the World\\n\\n\\nThey say that man is mighty, he governs land and sea;\\nHe wields a mighty scepter o'er lesser powers that be;\\nBy a mightier power and stronger, man from his throne is hurled,\\nAnd the hand that rocks the cradle is the hand that rules the world.\\n\\nBlessings on the hand of woman!

our eyes, but we cannot help knowing\\nThat skies are clear and grass is growing;\\nThe breeze comes whispering in our ear,\\nThat dandelions are blossoming near,\\n  That maize has sprouted, that streams are flowing,\\nThat the river is bluer than the sky,\\nThat the robin is plastering his house hard by;\\nAnd if the breeze kept the good news back,\\nFor other couriers we should not lack;\\n  We could guess it all by yon heifer\\'s lowing,--\\nAnd hark! how clear bold chanticleer,\\nWarmed with the new wine of the year,\\n  Tells all in his lusty crowing!\\n\\nJoy comes, grief goes, we know not how;\\nEverything is happy now,\\n  Everything is upward striving;\\n\\'T is as easy now for the heart to be true\\nAs for grass to be green or skies to be blue,--\\n  \\'T is the natural way of living.\\nWho knows whither the clouds have fled?\\n  In the unscarred heaven they leave no wake,\\nAnd the eyes forget the tears they have shed,\\n  The heart forgets its sorrow and ache;\\nThe

And yet, through the gloom and the light,\\n  The fate of a nation was riding that night;\\n  And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,\\nKindled the land into flame with its heat.\\nHe has left the village and mounted the steep,\\nAnd beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,\\n  Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;\\nAnd under the alders, that skirt its edge,\\nNow soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,\\n  Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.\\n\\nIt was twelve by the village clock\\n  When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.\\nHe heard the crowing of the cock,\\nAnd the barking of the farmer\\'s dog,\\nAnd felt the damp of the river fog,\\n  That rises after the sun goes down.\\n\\nIt was one by the village clock\\nWhen he galloped into Lexington,\\nHe saw the gilded weathercock\\nSwim in the moonlight as he passed,\\n  And the meeting house windows, blank and bare,\\n  Gaze at him with a spectral glare\\nAs if they already stood aghast\\n  At the bloody work they would look upon.\\n\\nIt was two by the village clock\\n  When he came to the bridge in Concord town.\\nHe heard the bleating of the flock,\\nAnd the twittering of birds among the trees,\\nAnd felt the breath of the morning breeze\\n  Blowing over the meadows brown.\\nAnd one was safe and asleep in his bed\\n  Who at the bridge would be first to fall,\\nWho that day would be lying dead,\\n  Pierced by a British musket ball.\\n\\nYou know the rest. In the books you have read\\nHow the British regulars fired and fled--\\nHow the farmers gave them ball for ball,\\nFrom behind each fence and farmyard wall,\\nChasing the red coats down the lane,\\nThen crossing the fields to emerge again\\nUnder the trees at the turn of the road,\\nAnd only pausing to fire and load.\\n\\nSo through the night rode Paul Revere;\\n  And so through the night went his cry of alarm\\nTo every Middlesex village and farm--\\nA cry of defiance, and not of fear--\\nA voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,\\nAnd a word that shall echo forever-more;\\nFor borne on the night wind of the past,\\nThrough all our history to the last,\\nIn the hour of darkness and peril and need,\\n  The people will waken and listen to hear\\nThe hurrying hoof beats of that steed,\\n  And the midnight message of Paul Revere.\\n\\n    _Henry W. Longfellow._', 'In Flanders Fields\\n\\n\\nIn Flanders fields the poppies grow\\nBetween the crosses, row on row,\\nThat mark our place; and in the sky\\nThe larks, still bravely singing, fly,\\nScarce heard amid the guns below.\\n\\nWe are the dead.

Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again,\\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\\nTo mix forever with the elements,\\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.\\nYet not to thine eternal resting-place\\nShalt thou retire alone--nor couldst thou wish\\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\\nWith patriarchs of the infant world--with kings.\\nThe powerful of the earth--the wise, the good,\\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,\\nAll in one mighty sepulchre. The hills,\\nRock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun,--the vales\\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\\nThe venerable woods--rivers that move\\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks\\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\\nOld ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--\\nAre but the solemn decorations all\\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\\nThrough the still lapse of ages. All that tread\\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\\nThat slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\\nOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,\\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,\\nSave his own dashings--yet, the dead are there;\\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\\nIn their last sleep--the dead reign there alone.\\nSo shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw\\nIn silence from the living, and no friend\\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\\nHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come\\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\\nOf ages glide away, the sons of men,--\\nThe youth in life's green spring, and he who goes\\nIn the full strength of years, matron, and maid,\\nAnd the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,--\\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side,\\nBy those who in their turn shall follow them.\\n\\nSo live, that when thy summons comes to join\\nThe innumerable caravan which moves\\nTo the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\\nThou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,\\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\\n\\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\", 'The First Settler\\'s Story\\n\\n\\nIt ain\\'t the funniest thing a man can do--\\nExisting in a country when it\\'s new;\\nNature, who moved in first--a good long while--\\nHas things already somewhat her own style,\\nAnd she don\\'t want her woodland splendors battered,\\nHer rustic furniture broke up and scattered,\\nHer paintings, which long years ago were done\\nBy that old splendid artist-king, the sun,\\nTorn down and dragged in civilization\\'s gutter,\\nOr sold to purchase settlers\\' bread and butter.\\nShe don\\'t want things exposed from porch to closet,\\nAnd so she kind o\\' nags the man who does it.\\nShe carries in her pockets bags of seeds,\\nAs general agent of the thriftiest weeds;\\nShe sends her blackbirds, in the early morn,\\nTo superintend his fields of planted corn;\\nShe gives him rain past any duck\\'s desire--\\nThen maybe several weeks of quiet fire;\\nShe sails mosquitoes--leeches perched on wings--\\nTo poison him with blood-devouring stings;\\nShe loves her ague-muscle to display,\\nAnd shake him up--say every other day;\\nWith, thoughtful, conscientious care she makes\\nThose travelin\\' poison-bottles, rattlesnakes;\\nShe finds time, \\'mongst her other family cares,\\nTo keep in stock good wild-cats, wolves, and bears.\\n\\nWell, when I first infested this retreat,\\nThings to my view looked frightful incomplete;\\nBut I had come with heart-thrift in my song,\\nAnd brought my wife and plunder right along;\\nI hadn\\'t a round trip ticket to go back,\\nAnd if I had there wasn\\'t no railroad track;\\nAnd drivin\\' East was what I couldn\\'t endure:\\nI hadn\\'t started on a circular tour.\\n\\nMy girl-wife was as brave as she was good,\\nAnd helped me every blessed way she could;\\nShe seemed to take to every rough old tree,\\nAs sing\\'lar as when first she took to me.\\nShe kep\\' our little log-house neat as wax,\\nAnd once I caught her fooling with my axe.\\nShe learned a hundred masculine things to do:\\nShe aimed a shot-gun pretty middlin\\' true,\\nAlthough in spite of my express desire,\\nShe always shut her eyes before she\\'d fire.\\nShe hadn\\'t the muscle (though she _had_ the heart)\\nIn out-door work to take an active part;\\nThough in our firm of Duty and Endeavor\\nShe wasn\\'t no silent partner whatsoever.\\nWhen I was logging, burning, choppin\\' wood,\\nShe\\'d linger round and help me all she could,\\nAnd keep me fresh-ambitious all the while,\\nAnd lifted tons just with her voice and smile.\\nWith no desire my glory for to rob,\\nShe used to stan\\' around and boss the job;\\nAnd when first-class success my hands befell,\\nWould proudly say, \"_We_ did that pretty well!\"\\nShe _was_ delicious, both to hear and see--\\nThat pretty wife-girl that kep\\' house for me.\\n\\nWell, neighborhoods meant counties in those days;\\nThe roads didn\\'t have accommodating ways;\\nAnd maybe weeks would pass before she\\'d see--\\nAnd much less talk with--any one but me.\\nThe Indians sometimes showed their sun-baked faces,\\nBut they didn\\'t teem with conversational graces;\\nSome ideas from the birds and trees she stole,\\nBut \\'twasn\\'t like talking with a human soul;\\nAnd finally I thought that I could trace\\nA half heart-hunger peering from her face.\\nThen she would drive it back and shut the door;\\nOf course that only made me see it more.\\n\\'Twas hard to see her give her life to mine,\\nMaking a steady effort not to pine;\\n\\'Twas hard to hear that laugh bloom out each minute,\\nAnd recognize the seeds of sorrow in it.\\nNo misery makes a close observer mourn\\nLike hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne;\\nThere\\'s nothing sets the sympathies to paining\\nLike a complaining woman uncomplaining.\\nIt always draws my breath out into sighs\\nTo see a brave look in a woman\\'s eyes.\\n\\nWell, she went on, as plucky as could be,\\nFighting the foe she thought I did not see,\\nAnd using her heart-horticultural powers\\nTo turn that forest to a bed of flowers.\\nYou cannot check an unadmitted sigh,\\nAnd so I had to soothe her on the sly,\\nAnd secretly to help her draw her load;\\nAnd soon it came to be an up-hill road.\\nHard work bears hard upon the average pulse,\\nEven with satisfactory results;\\nBut when effects are scarce, the heavy strain\\nFalls dead and solid on the heart and brain.\\nAnd when we\\'re bothered, it will oft occur\\nWe seek blame-timber; and I lit on her;\\nAnd looked at her with daily lessening favor,\\nFor what I knew she couldn\\'t help, to save her.\\nAnd Discord, when he once had called and seen us,\\nCame round quite often, and edged in between us.\\n\\nOne night, when I came home unusual late,\\nToo hungry and too tired to feel first-rate,\\nHer supper struck me wrong (though I\\'ll allow\\nShe hadn\\'t much to strike with, anyhow);\\nAnd when I went to milk the cows, and found\\nThey\\'d wandered from their usual feeding ground,\\nAnd maybe\\'d left a few long miles behind \\'em,\\nWhich I must copy, if I meant to find \\'em,\\nFlash-quick the stay-chains of my temper broke,\\nAnd in a, trice these hot words I had spoke:\\n\"You ought to\\'ve kept the animals in view,\\nAnd drove \\'em in; you\\'d nothing else to do.\\nThe heft of all our life on me must fall;\\nYou just lie round and let me do it all.\"\\n\\nThat speech--it hadn\\'t been gone a half a minute\\nBefore I saw the cold black poison in it;\\nAnd I\\'d have given all I had, and more,\\nTo\\'ve only safely got it back in-door.\\nI\\'m now what most folks \"well-to-do\" would call\\nI feel to-day as if I\\'d give it all,\\nProvided I through fifty years might reach\\nAnd kill and bury that half-minute speech.\\n\\nShe handed back no words, as I could hear;\\nShe didn\\'t frown; she didn\\'t shed a tear;\\nHalf proud, half crushed, she stood and looked me o\\'er,\\nLike some one she had never seen before!\\nBut such a sudden anguish-lit surprise\\nI never viewed before in human eyes.\\n(I\\'ve seen it oft enough since in a dream;\\nIt sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream.)\\n\\nNext morning, when, stone-faced, but heavy-hearted,\\nWith dinner pail and sharpened axe I started\\nAway for my day\\'s work--she watched the door.\\nAnd followed me half way to it or more;\\nAnd I was just a-turning round at this,\\nAnd asking for my usual good-by kiss;\\nBut on her lip I saw a proudish curve,\\nAnd in her eye a shadow of reserve;\\nAnd she had shown--perhaps half unawares--\\nSome little independent breakfast airs;\\nAnd so the usual parting didn\\'t occur,\\nAlthough her eyes invited me to her!\\nOr rather half invited me, for she\\nDidn\\'t advertise to furnish kisses free;\\nYou always had--that is, I had--to pay\\nFull market price, and go more\\'n half the way.\\nSo, with a short \"Good-by,\" I shut the door,\\nAnd left her as I never had before.\\nBut when at noon my lunch I came to eat.\\nPut up by her so delicately neat--\\nChoicer, somewhat, than yesterday\\'s had been,\\nAnd some fresh, sweet-eyed pansies she\\'d put in--\\n\"Tender and pleasant thoughts,\" I knew they meant--\\nIt seemed as if her kiss with me she\\'d sent;\\nThen I became once more her humble lover,\\nAnd said, \"To-night I\\'ll ask forgiveness of her.\"\\n\\nI went home over-early on that eve,\\nHaving contrived to make myself believe,\\nBy various signs I kind o\\' knew and guessed,\\nA thunder-storm was coming from the west.\\n(\\'Tis strange, when one sly reason fills the heart,\\nHow many honest ones will take its part:\\nA dozen first-class reasons said \\'twas right\\nThat I should strike home early on that night.)\\n\\nHalf out of breath, the cabin door I swung,\\nWith tender heart-words trembling on my tongue;\\nBut all within looked desolate and bare:\\nMy house had lost its soul,--she was not there!\\nA penciled note was on the table spread,\\nAnd these are something like the words it said:\\n\"The cows have strayed away again, I fear;\\nI watched them pretty close; don\\'t scold me, dear.\\nAnd where they are, I think I nearly know:\\nI heard the bell not very long ago....\\nI\\'ve hunted for them all the afternoon;\\nI\\'ll try once more--I think I\\'ll find them soon.\\nDear, if a burden I have been to you,\\nAnd haven\\'t helped you as I ought to do.\\nLet old-time memories my forgiveness plead;\\nI\\'ve tried to do my best--I have indeed.\\nDarling, piece out with love the strength I lack,\\nAnd have kind words for me when I get back.\"\\n\\nScarce did I give this letter sight and tongue--\\nSome swift-blown rain-drops to the window clung,\\nAnd from the clouds a rough, deep growl proceeded:\\nMy thunder-storm had come, now \\'twasn\\'t needed.\\nI rushed out-door. The air was stained with black:\\nNight had come early, on the storm-cloud\\'s back:\\nAnd everything kept dimming to the sight,\\nSave when the clouds threw their electric light;\\nWhen for a flash, so clean-cut was the view,\\nI\\'d think I saw her--knowing \\'twas not true.\\nThrough my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray,\\nAs if the ocean waves had lost their way;\\nScarcely a pause the thunder-battle made,\\nIn the bold clamor of its cannonade.\\nAnd she, while I was sheltered, dry, and warm,\\nWas somewhere in the clutches of this storm!\\nShe who, when storm-frights found her at her best,\\nHad always hid her white face on my breast!\\n\\nMy dog, who\\'d skirmished round me all the day,\\nNow crouched and whimpering, in a corner lay;\\nI dragged him by the collar to the wall,\\nI pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl--\\n\"Track her, old boy!\" I shouted; and he whined,\\nMatched eyes with me, as if to read my mind,\\nThen with a yell went tearing through the wood,\\nI followed him, as faithful as I could.\\nNo pleasure-trip was that, through flood and flame;\\nWe raced with death: we hunted noble game.\\nAll night we dragged the woods without avail;\\nThe ground got drenched--we could not keep the trail,\\nThree times again my cabin home I found,\\nHalf hoping she might be there, safe and sound;\\nBut each time \\'twas an unavailing care:\\nMy house had lost its soul; she was not there!\\n\\nWhen, climbing--the wet trees, next morning-sun.\\nLaughed at the ruin that the night had done,\\nBleeding and drenched, by toil and sorrow bent,\\nBack to what used to be my home I went.\\nBut as I neared our little clearing-ground--\\nListen!--I heard the cow-bell\\'s tinkling sound.\\nThe cabin door was just a bit ajar;\\nIt gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star,\\n\"Brave heart,\" I said, \"for such a fragile form!\\nShe made them guide her homeward through the storm!\"\\nSuch pangs of joy I never felt before.\\n\"You\\'ve come!\" I shouted and rushed through the door.\\n\\nYes, she had come--and gone again. She lay\\nWith all her young life crushed and wrenched away--\\nLay, the heart-ruins of oar home among,\\nNot far from where I killed her with my tongue.\\nThe rain-drops glittered \\'mid her hair\\'s long strands,\\nThe forest thorns had torn her feet and hands,\\nAnd \\'midst the tears--brave tears--that one could trace\\nUpon the pale but sweetly resolute face,\\nI once again the mournful words could read,\\n\"I have tried to do my best--I have, indeed.\"\\n\\nAnd now I\\'m mostly done; my story\\'s o\\'er;\\nPart of it never breathed the air before.\\n\\'Tisn\\'t over-usual, it must be allowed,\\nTo volunteer heart-history to a crowd,\\nAnd scatter \\'mongst them confidential tears,\\nBut you\\'ll protect an old man with his years;\\nAnd wheresoe\\'er this story\\'s voice can reach,\\nThis is the sermon I would have it preach:\\n\\nBoys flying kites haul in their white-winged birds:\\nYou can\\'t do that way when you\\'re flying words.\\n\"Careful with fire,\" is good advice we know:\\n\"Careful with words,\" is ten times doubly so.\\nThoughts unexpressed may sometimes fall back dead,\\nBut God himself can\\'t kill them when they\\'re said!\\nYon have my life-grief: do not think a minute\\n\\'Twas told to take up time.

morgan s men are coming frau they re galloping on this way i m sent to warn the neighbors he isn t a mile behind he sweeps up all the horses every horse that he can find morgan morgan the raider and morgan s terrible men with bowie knives and pistols are galloping up the glen the lad rode down the valley and i stood still at the door the baby laughed and prattled playing with spools on the floor kentuck was out in the pasture conrad my man was gone nearer nearer morgan s men were galloping galloping on sudden i picked up baby and ran to the pasture bar kentuck i called kentucky she knew me ever so far i led her down the gully that turns off there to the right and tied her to the bushes her head was just out of sight as i ran back to the log house at once there came a sound the ring of hoofs galloping hoofs trembling over the ground coming into the turnpike out from the white woman glen morgan morgan the raider and morgan s terrible men as near they drew and nearer my heart beat fast in alarm but still i stood in the doorway with baby on my arm they came they passed with spur and whip in haste they sped along morgan morgan the raider and his band six hundred strong weary they looked and jaded riding through night and through day pushing on east to the river many long miles away to the border strip where virginia runs up into the west and fording the upper ohio before they could stop to rest on like the wind they hurried and morgan rode in advance bright were his eyes like live coals as he gave me a sideways glance and i was just breathing freely after my choking pain when the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein frightened i was to death sir i scarce dared look in his face as he asked for a drink of water and glanced around the place i gave him a cup and he smiled twas only a boy you see faint and worn with dim blue eyes and he d sailed on the tennessee only sixteen he was sir a fond mother s only son off and away with morgan before his life had begun the damp drops stood on his temples drawn was the boyish mouth and i thought me of the mother waiting down in the south oh pluck was he to the backbone and clear grit through and through boasted and bragged like a trooper but the big words wouldn t do the boy was dying sir dying as plain as plain could be worn out by his ride with morgan up from the tennessee but when i told the laddie that i too was from the south water came in his dim eyes and quivers around his mouth do you know the blue grass country he wistful began to say then swayed like a willow sapling and fainted dead away i had him into the log house and worked and brought him to i fed him and i coaxed him as i thought his mother d do and when the lad got better and the noise in his head was gone morgan s men were miles away galloping galloping on oh i must go he muttered i must be up and away morgan morgan is waiting for me oh what will morgan say but i heard a sound of tramping and kept him back from the door the ringing sound of horses hoofs that i had heard before and on on came the soldiers the michigan cavalry and fast they rode and black they looked galloping rapidly they had followed hard on morgan s track they had followed day and night but of morgan and morgan s raiders they had never caught a sight and rich ohio sat startled through all those summer days for strange wild men were galloping over her broad highways now here now there now seen now gone now north now east now west through river valleys and cornland farms sweeping away her best a bold ride and a long ride but they were taken at last they almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast but the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they gained the ford and morgan morgan the raider laid down his terrible sword well i kept the boy till evening kept him against his will but he was too weak to follow and sat there pale and still when it was cool and dusky you ll wonder to hear me tell but i stole down to that gully and brought up kentucky belle i kissed the star on her forehead my pretty gentle lass but i knew that she d be happy back in the old blue grass a suit of clothes of conrad s with all the money i had and kentuck pretty kentuck i gave to the worn out lad i guided him to the southward as well as i know how the boy rode off with many thanks and many a backward bow and then the glow it faded and my heart began to swell as down the glen away she went my lost kentucky belle when conrad came in the evening the moon was shining high baby and i were both crying i couldn t tell him why but a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the wall and a thin old horse with drooping head stood in kentucky s stall well he was kind and never once said a hard word to me he knew i couldn t help it twas all for the tennessee but after the war was over just think what came to pass a letter sir and the two were safe back in the old blue grass the lad had got across the border riding kentucky belle and kentuck she was thriving and fat and hearty and well he cared for her and kept her nor touched her with whip or spur ah we ve had many horses since but never a horse like her constance f woolson ', 'an inventor s wife i remember it all so very well the first of my married life that i can t believe it was years ago it doesn t seem true at all why i just can see the little church where they made us man and wife and the merry glow of the first wood fire that danced on our cottage wall we were happy yes and we prospered too the house belonged to joe and then he worked in the planing mill and drew the best of pay and our cup was full when joey came our baby boy you know so all went well till that mill burned down and the owner moved away it wasn t long till joe found work but twas never quite the same never steady with smaller pay so to make the two ends meet he fell to inventin some machine i don t recall the name but he d sit for hours in his little shop that opens toward the street sit for hours bent over his work his tools all strewn about i used to want to go in there to dust and sweep the floor but twas just as if twas the parson there writing his sermon out even the baby bless the child learned never to slam that door people called him a clever man and folks from the city came to look at his new invention and wish my joe success and joe would say little woman for that was my old pet name if my plan succeeds you shall have a coach and pair and a fine silk dress i didn t want em the grand new things but it made the big tears start to see my joe with his restless eyes his fingers worn away to the skin and bone for he wouldn t eat and it almost broke my heart when he tossed at night from side to side till the dawning of the day of course with it all he lost his place i couldn t blame the man the foreman there at the factory for losing faith in joe for his mind was never upon his work but on some invention plan as with folded arms and his head bent down he wandered to and fro yet he kept on workin at various things till our little money went for wheels and screws and metal casts and things i had never seen and i ceased to ask any pay my dear with the answer not a cent when his lock and his patent saw had failed he clung to that great machine i remember one special thing that year he had bought some costly tool when we wanted our boy to learn to read he was five years old you know he went to his class with cold bare feet till at last he came from school and gravely said don t send me back the children tease me so i hadn t the heart to cross the child so while i sat and sewed he would rock his little sister in the cradle at my side and when the struggle was hardest and i felt keen hunger s goad driving me almost to despair the little baby died her father came to the cradle side as she lay so small and white maggie he said i have killed this child and now i am killing you i swear by heaven i will give it up yet like a thief that night he stole to the shop and worked his brow all wet with a clammy dew i cannot tell how i lived that week my little boy and i too proud to beg too weak to work and the weather cold and wild i can only think of one dark night when the rain poured from the sky and the wind went wailing round the house like the ghost of my buried child joe still toiled in the little shop somebody clicked the gate a neighbor lad brought in the mail and laid it on the floor but i sat half stunned by my heavy grief crouched over the empty grate till i heard the crack of a pistol shot and i sprang to the workshop door that door was locked and the bolt shut fast i could not cry nor speak but i snatched my boy from the corner there sick with a sudden dread and carried him out through the garden plot forgetting my arms were weak forgetting the rainy torrent that beat on my bare young head the front door yielded to my touch i staggered faintly in fearing what he stood unharmed though the wall showed a jagged hole in his trembling hand his aim had failed and the great and deadly sin of his own life s blood was not yet laid on the poor man s tortured soul but the pistol held another charge i knew and like something mad i shook my fist in my poor man s face and shrieked at him fierce and wild how can you dare to rob us so and i seized the little lad how can you dare to rob your wife and your little helpless child all of a sudden he bowed his head while from his nerveless hand that hung so limp i almost feared to see the pistol fall maggie he said in a low low voice you see me as i stand a hopeless man my plan has failed that letter tells you all then for a moment the house was still as ever the house of death only the drip of the rain outside for the storm was almost o er but no there followed another sound and i started caught my breath as a stalwart man with a heavy step came in at the open door i shall always think him an angel sent from heaven in a human guise he must have guessed our awful state he couldn t help but see there was something wrong but never a word never a look in his eyes told what he thought as in kindly way he talked to joe and me he was come from a thriving city firm and they d sent him here to say that one of joe s inventions was a great successful thing and which do you think his window catch that he d tinkered up one day and we were to have a good per cent on the sum that each would bring and then the pleasant stranger went and we wakened as from a dream my man bent down his head and said little woman you ve saved my life the worn look gone from his dear gray eyes and in its place a gleam from the sun that has shone so brightly since on joe and his happy wife jeannie pendleton ewing ', 'the two glasses there sat two glasses filled to the brim on a

and fro in an easy chair whose creaky craw told a tale of long ago while down by her side on the kitchen floor stood a basket of worsted balls a score the good man dozed o er the latest news till the light in his pipe went out and unheeded the kitten with cunning paws rolled and tangled the balls about yet still sat the wife in the ancient chair swaying to and fro in the fire light glare but anon a misty teardrop came in her eyes of faded blue then trickled down in a furrow deep like a single drop of dew so deep was the channel so silent the stream that the good man saw naught but the dimmed eye beam yet marveled he much that the cheerful light of her eye had heavy grown and marveled he more at the tangled balls so he said in a gentle tone i have shared thy joys since our marriage vow conceal not from me thy sorrows now then she spoke of the time when the basket there was filled to the very brim and now there remained of the goodly pile but a single pair for him then wonder not at the dimmed eye light there s but one pair of stockings to mend to night i cannot but think of the busy feet whose wrappings were wont to lay in the basket awaiting the needle s time now wandering so far away how the sprightly steps to a mother dear unheeded fell on the careless ear for each empty nook in the basket old by the hearth there s a vacant seat and i miss the shadows from off the wall and the patter of many feet tis for this that a tear gathered over my sight at the one pair of stockings to mend to night twas said that far through the forest wild and over the mountains bold was a land whose rivers and darkening caves were gemmed with the rarest gold then my first born turned from the oaken door and i knew the shadows were only four another went forth on the foaming wave and diminished the basket s store but his feet grew cold so weary and cold they ll never be warm any more and this nook in its emptiness seemeth to me to give forth no voice but the moan of the sea two others have gone toward the setting sun and made them a home in its light and fairy fingers have taken their share to mend by the fireside bright some other baskets their garments will fill but mine

other things like that which he had accumulated and the maid of his heart was up above surrounded by hat and gown and glove and a thousand things which women love but no man knoweth the names thereof and the young man sat and waited you will scarce believe the things i tell but the truth thereof i know full well though how may not be stated but i swear to you that the maiden took a sort of half breed thin stove hook and heated it well in the gaslight there and thrust it into her head or hair then she took something off the bed and hooked it onto her hair or head and piled it high and piled it higher and drove it home with staples of wire and the young man anxiously waited then she took a thing she called a puff and some very peculiar whitish stuff and using about a half a peck she spread it over her face and neck deceit was a thing she hated and she looked as fair as a lilied bower or a pound of lard or a sack of flour and the young man wearily waited then she took a garment of awful shape and it wasn t a waist nor yet a cape but it looked like a piece of ancient mail or an instrument from a russian jail and then with a fearful groan and gasp she squeezed herself in its deathly clasp so fair and yet so fated and then with a move like i don t know what she tied it on with a double knot and the young man wofully waited then she put on a dozen different things a mixture of buttons and hooks and strings till she strongly resembled a notion store then taking some seventeen pins or more she thrust them into her ruby lips then stuck them around from waist to hips and never once hesitated and the maiden didn t know perhaps that the man below had had seven naps and that now he sleepily waited and then she tried to put on her hat ah me a trying ordeal was that she tipped it high and she tried it low but every way that the thing would go only made her more agitated it wouldn t go straight and it caught her hair and she wished she could hire a man to swear but alas the only man lingering there was the one who wildly waited and then before she could take her leave she had to puff up her monstrous sleeve then a little dab here and a wee pat there and a touch or two to her hindmost hair then around the room with the utmost care she thoughtfully circulated then she seized her gloves and a chamoiskin some breath perfume and a long stickpin a bonbon box and a cloak and some eau de cologne and chewing gum her opera glass and sealskin muff a fan and a heap of other stuff then she hurried down but ere she spoke something about the maiden broke so she scurried

came to buy save the black eyed rebel watching from the corner of her eye now who will buy my apples he shouted long and loud and who wants my potatoes he repeated to the crowd but from all the people

the fathers far away who were fighting for the freedom that they meant to gain or die and a tear like silver glistened in the corner of her eye but the treasures how to get them crept the question

fired her eye so she resolutely walked up to the wagon old and red may i have a dozen apples for a kiss she sweetly said and the brown face flushed to scarlet for the boy was somewhat shy and he saw her laughing at him from the corner of her eye you may have them all for nothing and more if you want quoth he i will have them my good fellow but can pay for them said she and she clambered on the

bearded men and so when the signals from old fort wood set an army of veterans wild he flung down his drum which spun down the hill like the ball of a wayward child and then he fell in with the foremost ranks of brave old company g as we charged by the flank with our colors ahead and our columns closed up like a v in the long swinging lines of that splendid advance when the flags of our corps floated out like the ribbons that dance in the jubilant lines of the march of a gala day rout he charged with the ranks though he carried no gun for the colonel had said him nay and he breasted the blast of the bristling guns and the shock of the sickening fray and when by his side they were falling like hail he sprang to a comrade slain and shouldered his musket and bore it as true as the hand that was dead in pain twas dearly we loved him our drummer boy with a fire in his bright black eye that flashed forth a spirit too great for his form he only was just so high as tall perhaps as your little lad who scarcely reaches your shoulder though his heart was the heart of a veteran then a trifle it may be bolder he pressed to the front our lad so leal and the works were almost won a moment more and our flags had swung o er the muzzle of murderous gun but a raking fire swept the van and he fell mid the wounded and slain with his wee wan face turned up to him who feeleth his children s pain again and again our lines fell back and again with shivering shocks they flung themselves on the rebels works as ships are tossed on rocks to be crushed and broken and scattered amain

and we counted our comrades slain and one said johnny our drummer boy is grievously shot and lies just under the enemy s breastwork if left on the field he dies then all the blood that was in me surged up to my aching brow and my heart leaped up like a ball in my throat i can feel it even now and i said i would bring that boy from the field if god would spare my breath if all the guns in mission ridge should thunder the threat of death i crept and crept up the ghastly ridge by the wounded and the dead with the moans of my comrades right and left behind me and yet ahead till i came to the form of our drummer boy in his blouse of dusty blue with his face to the foe neath the enemy s guns where the blast of the battle blew and his gaze as he met my own just there would have melted a heart of stone as he tried like a wounded bird to rise and placed his hand in my own and he said in a voice half smothered though its whispering thrills me yet i think in a moment more that i would have stood on that parapet but now i nevermore will climb and sergeant when you see the men go up those breastworks there just stop and waken me for though i cannot make the charge and join the cheers that rise i may forget my pain to see the old flag kiss the skies well it was hard to treat him so his poor limb shattered sore but i raised him on my shoulder and to the surgeon bore and the boys who saw us coming each gave a shout of joy and uttered fervent prayers for him our valiant drummer boy when sped the news that fighting joe had saved the union right with his legions fresh from lookout and that thomas massed his might and forced the rebel center and our cheering ran like wild and sherman s heart was happy as the heart of a little child when grant from his lofty outlook saw our flags by the hundred fly along the slopes of mission ridge where er he cast his eye and when we heard the thrilling news of the mighty battle done the fearful contest ended and the glorious victory won then

duty wed can nevermore grow cold and when they tell of heroes and the laurels they have won of the scars they are doomed to carry of the deeds that they have done of the horror to be biding among the ghastly dead the gory sod beneath them the bursting shell o erhead my heart goes back to mission ridge and the drummer boy who lay with his face to the foe neath the enemy s guns in the charge of that

only smiled and nodded behind its thorny screen yet through that summer morning i lingered near the spot oh why do things seem sweeter if we possess them not my garden buds were blooming but all that i could see was that little mocking wild rose hanging just too high for me so in life s wider garden there are buds of promise too beyond our reach to gather but not beyond our view and like the

very great wonder nor so strange nor so bold a conceit that unless there s a boy there a whistling its music will not be complete it was late in the autumn of 40 we had come from our far eastern home just in season to build us a cabin ere the cold of the winter should come and we lived all the while in our wagon that husband was clearing the place where the house was to stand and the clearing and building it took many days so that our heads were scarce sheltered in under its roof when our store of provisions was almost exhausted and husband must journey for more and the nearest place where he could get them was yet such a distance away that it forced him from home to be absent at least a whole night and a day you see we d but two or three neighbors and the nearest was more than a mile and we hadn t found time yet to know them for we had been busy the while and the man who had helped at the raising just staid till the job was well done and as soon as his money was paid him had shouldered his axe and had gone well husband just kissed me and started i could scarcely suppress a deep groan at the thought of remaining with baby so long in the house alone for my dear i was childish and timid and braver ones might well have feared for the wild wolf was often heard howling and savages sometimes appeared but i smothered my grief and my terror till husband was off on his ride and then in my arms i took josey and all the day long sat and cried as i thought of the long dreary hours when the darkness of night should fall and i was so utterly helpless with no one in reach of my call and when the night came with its terrors to hide ev ry ray of light i hung up a quilt by the window and almost dead with affright i kneeled by the side of the cradle scarce daring to draw a full breath lest the baby should wake and its crying should bring us a horrible death there i knelt until late in the evening and scarcely an inch had i stirred when suddenly far in the distance a sound as of whistling i heard i started up dreadfully frightened for fear twas an indian s call and then very soon i remembered the red man ne er whistles at all and when i was sure twas a white man i thought were he coming for ill he d surely approach with more caution would come without warning and still then the sound coming nearer and nearer took the form of a tune light and gay and i knew i needn t fear evil from one who could whistle that way very soon i heard footsteps approaching then came a peculiar dull thump as if some one was heavily striking an ax in the top of a stump and then in another brief moment there came a light tap on the door when quickly i undid the fast ning and in stepped a boy and before there was either a question or answer or either had time to speak i just threw my glad arms around him and gave him a kiss on the cheek then i started back scared at my boldness but he only smiled at my fright as he said i m your neighbor s boy ellick come to tarry with you through the night we saw your husband go eastward and made up our minds where he d gone and i said to the rest of our people that woman is there all alone and i venture she s awfully lonesome and though she may have no great fear i think she would feel a bit safer if only a boy were but near so taking my axe on my shoulder for fear that a savage might stray across my path and need scalping i started right down this way and coming in sight of the cabin and thinking to save you alarm i whistled a tune just to show you i didn t intend any harm and so here i am at your service but if you don t want me to stay why all you need do is to say so and should ring my axe i ll away i dropped in a chair and near fainted just at thought of his leaving me then and his eye gave a knowing bright twinkle as he said i guess i ll remain and then i just sat there and told him how terribly frightened i d been how his face was to me the most welcome of any i ever had seen and then i lay down with the baby and slept all the blessed night through for i felt i was safe from all danger near so brave a young fellow and true so now my dear friend do you wonder since such a good reason i ve given why

the time of christmas not many months ago when the sky was black with wrath and rack and the earth was white with snow when loudly rang the tumult of winds and waves of strife in her home by the sea with her babe on her knee sat harry conquest s wife and he was on the ocean although she knew not where for never a lip could tell of the ship to lighten her heart s despair and her babe was fading and dying the pulse in the tiny wrist was all but still and the brow was chill and pale as the white sea mist jane conquest s heart was hopeless she could only weep and pray that the shepherd mild would take her child without a pain away the night was dark and darker and the storm grew stronger still and buried in deep and dreamless sleep lay the hamlet under the hill the fire was dead on the hearthstone within jane conquest s room and still sat she with her babe on her knee at prayer amid the gloom when borne above the tempest a sound fell on her ear thrilling her through for well she knew twas the voice of mortal fear and a light leaped in at the lattice sudden and swift and red crimsoning all the whited wall and the floor and the roof o erhead for one brief moment heedless of the babe upon her knee with the frenzied start of a frightened heart upon her feet rose she and through the quaint old casement she looks upon the sea thank god that the sight she saw that night so rare a sight should be hemmed in by many a billow with mad and foaming lip a mile from shore or hardly more she saw a gallant ship and to her horror she beheld it aflame from stem to stern for there seemed no speck on all that wreck where the fierce fire did not burn till the night was like a sunset and the sea like a sea of blood and the rocks and shore were bathed all o er and drenched with the gory flood she looked and looked till the terror went creeping through every limb and her breath came quick and her heart grew sick and her sight grew dizzy and dim and her lips had lost their utterance for she tried but could not speak and her feelings found no channel of sound in prayer or sob or shriek once more that cry of anguish thrilled through the tempest s strife and it stirred again in heart and brain the active thinking life and the light of an inspiration leaped to her brightened eye and on lip and brow was written now a purpose pure and high swiftly she turns and softly she crosses the chamber floor and faltering not in his tiny cot she laid the babe she bore and then with a holy impulse she sank to her knees and made a lowly prayer in the silence there and this was the prayer she prayed o christ who didst bear the scourging and who now dost wear the crown i at thy feet o true and sweet would lay my burden down thou bad st me love and cherish the babe thou gavest me and i have kept thy word nor stept aside from following thee and lo my boy is dying and vain is all my care and my burden s weight is very great yea greater than i can bear o lord thou know st what peril doth threat these poor men s lives and i a woman most weak and human do plead for their waiting wives thou canst not let them perish up lord in thy strength and save from the scorching breath of this terrible death on this cruel winter wave take thou my babe and watch it no care is like to thine and let thy power in this perilous hour supply what lack is mine and so her prayer she ended and rising to her feet gave one long look at the cradle nook where the child s faint pulses beat and then with softest footsteps retrod the chamber floor and noiselessly groped for the latch and oped and crossed the cottage door and through the tempest bravely jane conquest fought her way by snowy deep and slippery steep to where her duty lay and she journeyed onward breathless and weary and sore and faint yet forward pressed with the strength and the zest and the ardor of a saint solemn and weird and lonely amid its countless graves stood the old gray church on its tall rock perch secure from the sea and its waves and beneath its sacred shadow lay the hamlet safe and still for however the sea and the wind might be there was quiet under the hill jane conquest reached the churchyard and stood by the old church door but the oak was tough and had bolts enough and her strength was frail and poor so she crept through a narrow window and climbed the belfry stair and grasped the rope sole cord of hope for the mariners in despair and the wild wind helped her bravely and she wrought with an earnest will and the clamorous bell spoke out right well to the hamlet under the hill and it roused the slumbering fishers nor its warning task gave o er till a hundred fleet and eager feet were hurrying to the shore and then it ceased its ringing for the woman s work was done and many a boat that was now afloat showed man s work had begun but the ringer in the belfry lay motionless and cold with the cord of hope the church bell rope still in her frozen hold how long she lay it boots not but she woke from her swoon at last in her own bright room to find the gloom and the grief and the peril past with the sense of joy within her and the christ s sweet presence near and friends around and the cooing sound of her babe s voice in her ear and they told her all the story how a brave and gallant few o ercame each check and reached the wreck and saved the hopeless crew and how the curious sexton had climbed the belfry stair and of his fright when cold and white he found her lying there and how when they had borne her back to her home again the child she left with a heart bereft of hope and weary with pain was found within his cradle in a quiet slumber laid with a peaceful smile on his lips the while and the wasting sickness stayed and she said twas the christ who watched it and brought it safely through and she praised his truth and his tender ruth who had saved her darling too ', 'nathan hale to drum beat and heart beat a soldier marches by there is color in his cheek there is

a rich old chap but when by chance her glances fell on a friend who had lately married well her spirits sunk and a vague unrest and a nameless longing filled her breast a wish she wouldn t have had made known to have an establishment of her own tom fudge came slowly through the throng with chestnut hair worn pretty long he saw kate ketchem in the crowd and knowing her slightly stopped and bowed then asked her to give him a single flower saying he d think it a priceless dower out from those with which she was decked she took the poorest she could select and blushed as she gave it looking down to call attention to her gown thanks said fudge and he thought how dear flowers must be at that time of year then several charming remarks he made asked if she sang or danced or played and being exhausted inquired whether she thought it was going to be pleasant weather and kate displayed her jewelry and dropped her lashes becomingly and listened with no attempt to disguise the admiration in her eyes at last like one who has nothing to say he turned around and walked away kate ketchem smiled and said you bet i ll catch that fudge and his money yet he s rich enough to keep me in clothes and i think i could manage him as i chose he could aid my father as well as not and buy my brother a splendid yacht my mother for money should never fret and all it cried for the baby should get and after that with what he could spare i d make a show at a charity fair tom fudge looked back as he crossed the sill and saw kate ketchem standing still a girl more suited to my mind it isn t an easy thing to find and every thing that she has to wear proves her as rich as she is fair would she were mine and i to day had the old man s cash my debts to pay no creditors with a long account no tradesmen wanting that little amount but all my scores paid up when due by a father in law as rich as a jew but he thought of her brother not worth a straw and her mother that would be his in law so undecided he walked along and kate was left alone in the throng but a lawyer smiled whom he sought by stealth to ascertain old ketchem s wealth and as for kate she schemed and planned till one of the dancers claimed her hand he married her for her father s cash she married him to cut a dash but as to paying his debts do you know the father couldn t see it so and at hints for help kate s hazel eyes looked out in their innocent surprise and when tom thought of the way he had wed he longed for a single life instead and closed his eyes in a sulky mood regretting the days of his bachelorhood and said in a sort of reckless vein i d like to see her catch me again if i were free as on that night when i saw kate ketchem dressed in white she wedded him to be rich and gay but husband and children didn t pay he wasn t the prize she hoped to draw and wouldn t live with his mother in law and oft when she had to coax and pout in order to get him to take her out she thought how very attentive and bright he seemed at the party that winter s night of his laugh as soft as a breeze of the south twas now on the other side of his mouth how he praised her dress and gems in his talk as he took a careful account of stock sometimes she hated the very walls hated her friends her dinners and calls till her weak affection to hatred turned like a dying tallow candle burned and for him who sat there her peace to mar smoking his everlasting cigar he wasn t the man she thought she saw and grief was duty and hate was law so she took up her burden with a groan saying only i might have known alas for kate and alas for fudge though i do not owe them any grudge and alas for any who find to their shame that two can play at their little game for of all hard things to bear and grin the hardest is

mingling light the deer upon the grassy mead was feeding full in sight he raised the rifle to his eye and from the cliffs around a sudden echo shrill and sharp gave back its deadly sound away into the neighboring wood the startled creature flew and crimson drops at morning lay amid the glimmering dew next evening shone the waxing moon as sweetly as before the deer upon the grassy mead was seen

that day the score stood two to four with but an inning left to play so when cooney died at second and burrows did the same a pallor wreathed the features of the patrons of the game a straggling few got up to go leaving there the rest with that hope which springs eternal within the human breast for they thought if only casey could get a whack at that they d put up even money now with casey at the bat but flynn preceded casey and likewise so did blake and the former was a puddin and the latter was a fake so on that stricken multitude a deathlike silence sat for there seemed but little chance of casey s getting to the bat but flynn let drive a single to the wonderment of all and the much despised blakey tore the cover off the ball and when the dust had lifted and they saw what had occurred there was blakey safe at second and flynn a huggin third then from the gladdened multitude went up a joyous yell it rumbled in the mountain tops it rattled in the dell it struck upon the hillside and rebounded on the flat for casey mighty casey was advancing to the bat there was ease in casey s manner as he stepped into his place there was pride in casey s bearing and a smile on casey s face and when responding to the cheers he lightly doffed his hat no stranger in the crowd could doubt twas casey at the bat ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with dirt five thousand tongues applauded when he wiped them on his shirt then while the new york pitcher ground the ball into his hip defiance gleamed in casey s eye a sneer curled casey s lip and now the leather covered sphere came hurtling through the air and casey stood a watching it in haughty grandeur there close by the sturdy batsman the ball unheeded sped that ain t my style said casey strike one the umpire said from the benches black with people there went up a muffled roar like the beating of great storm waves on a stern and distant shore kill him kill the umpire shouted someone on the stand and it s likely they d have killed him had not casey raised a hand with a smile of christian charity great casey s visage shone he stilled the rising tumult he bade the game go on he signaled to sir timothy once more the spheroid flew but casey still ignored it and the umpire said strike two fraud cried the maddened thousands and echo answered fraud but one scornful look from casey and the audience was awed they saw his face grow stern and cold they saw his muscles strain and they knew that casey wouldn t let that ball go by again the sneer is gone from casey s lip his teeth are clenched in hate he pounds with cruel violence his bat upon the plate and now the pitcher holds the ball and now he lets it go and now the air is shattered by the force of casey s blow oh somewhere in this favored land the sun is shining bright the band is playing somewhere and somewhere hearts are light and somewhere men are laughing and somewhere children shout but there is no joy in mudville mighty casey has struck out phineas thayer ', 'casey s revenge being a reply to casey at the bat there were saddened hearts in mudville for a week or even more there were muttered oaths and curses every fan in town was sore just think said one how soft it looked with casey at the bat and then to think he d go and spring a bush league trick like that all his past fame was forgotten he was now a hopeless shine they called him strike out casey from the mayor down the line and as he came to bat each day his bosom heaved a sigh while a look of hopeless fury shone in mighty casey s eye the lane is long someone has said that never turns again and fate though fickle often gives another chance to men and casey smiled his rugged face no longer wore a frown the pitcher who had started all the trouble came to town all mudville has assembled ten thousand fans had come to see the twirler who had put big casey on the bum and when he stepped into the box the multitude went wild he doffed his cap in proud disdain but casey only smiled play ball the umpire s voice rang out and then the game began but in that throng of thousands there was not a single fan who thought that mudville had a chance and with the setting sun their hopes sank low the rival team was leading four to one the last half of the ninth came round with no change in the score but when the first man up hit safe the crowd began to roar the din increased the echo of ten thousand shouts was heard when the pitcher hit the second and gave four balls to the third three men on base nobody out three runs to tie the game a triple meant the highest niche in mudville s hall of fame but here the rally ended and the gloom was deep as night when the fourth one fouled to catcher and the fifth flew out to right a dismal groan in chorus came a scowl was on each face when casey walked up bat in hand and slowly took his place his bloodshot eyes in fury gleamed his teeth were clinched in hate he gave his cap a vicious hook and pounded on the plate but fame is fleeting as the wind and glory fades away there were no wild and woolly cheers no glad acclaim this day they hissed and groaned and hooted as they clamored strike him out but casey gave no outward sign that he had heard the shout the pitcher smiled and cut one loose across the plate it spread another hiss another groan strike one the umpire said zip like a shot the second curve broke just below his knee strike two the umpire roared aloud but casey made no plea no roasting for the umpire now his was an easy lot but here the pitcher twirled again was that a rifle shot a whack a crack and out through space the leather pellet flew a blot against the distant sky a speck against the blue above the fence in center field in rapid whirling flight the sphere sailed on the blot grew dim and then was lost to sight ten thousand hats were thrown in air ten thousand threw a fit but no one ever found the ball that mighty casey hit oh somewhere in this favored land dark clouds may hide the sun and somewhere bands no longer play and children have no fun and somewhere over blighted lives there hangs a heavy pall but mudville hearts are happy now for casey hit the ball james wilson ', 'rock me to

where wade hampton boomed away the fight went neck and neck all day the weaker wing we held and held it with a will five several stubborn times we charged the battery on the hill and five times beaten back re formed and kept our column still at last from out the center fight spurred up a general s aide that battery must silenced be he cried as past he sped our colonel simply touched his cap and then with measured tread to lead the crouching line once more the grand old fellow came no wounded man but raised his head and strove to gasp his name and those who could not speak nor stir god blessed him just the same for he was all the world to us that hero gray and grim right well we knew that fearful slope we d climb with none but him though while his white head led the way we d charge hell s portals in this time we were not half way up when midst the storm of shell our leader with his sword upraised beneath our bayonets fell and as we bore him back the foe set up a joyous yell our hearts went with him back we swept and when the bugle said up charge again no man was there but hung his dogged head we ve no one left to lead us now the sullen soldiers said just then before the laggard line the colonel s horse we spied bay billy with his trappings on his nostrils swelling wide as though still on his gallant back the master sat astride right royally he took the place that was of old his wont and with a neigh that seemed to say above the battle s brunt how can the twenty second charge if i am not in front like statues rooted there we stood and gazed a little space above that floating mane we missed the dear familiar face but we saw bay billy s eye of fire and it gave us heart of grace no bugle call could rouse us all as that brave sight had done down all the battered line we felt a lightning impulse run up up the hill we followed bill and we captured every gun and when upon the conquered height died out the battle s hum vainly mid living and the dead we sought our leader dumb it seemed as if a spectre steed to win that day had come and then the dusk and dew of night fell softly o er the plain as though o er man s dread work of death the angels wept again and drew night s curtain gently round a thousand beds of pain all night the surgeons torches went the ghastly rows between all night with solemn step i paced the torn and bloody green but who that fought in the big war such dread sights have not seen at last the morning broke the lark sang in the merry skies as if to e en the sleepers there it said awake arise though naught but that last trump of all could ope their heavy eyes and then once more with banners gay stretched out the long brigade trimly upon the furrowed field the troops stood on parade and bravely mid the ranks were closed the gaps the fight had made not half the twenty second s men were in their place that morn and corporal dick who yester noon stood six brave fellows on now touched my elbow in the ranks for all between were gone ah who forgets that weary hour when as with misty eyes to call the old familiar roll the solemn sergeant tries one feels that thumping of the heart as no prompt voice replies and as in faltering tone and slow the last few names were said across the field some missing horse toiled up with weary tread it caught the sergeant s eye and quick bay billy s name he read yes there the old bay hero stood all safe from battle s harms and ere an order could be heard or the bugle s quick alarms down all the front from end to end the troops presented arms not all the shoulder straps on earth could

day by day the organ builder in his lonely chamber wrought day by day the soft air trembled to the music of his thought till at last the work was ended and no organ voice so grand ever yet had soared responsive to the master s magic hand ay so rarely was it builded that whenever groom and bride who in god s sight were well pleasing in the church stood side by side without touch or breath the organ of itself began to play and the very airs of heaven through the soft gloom seemed to stray he was young the organ builder and o er all the land his fame ran with fleet and eager footsteps like a swiftly rushing flame all the maidens heard the story all the maidens blushed and smiled by his youth and wondrous beauty and his great renown beguiled so he sought and won the fairest and the wedding day was set happy day the brightest jewel in the glad year s coronet but when they the portal entered he forgot his lovely bride forgot his love forgot his god and his heart swelled high with pride ah thought he how great a master am i when the organ plays how the vast cathedral arches will re echo with my praise up the aisle the gay procession moved the altar shone afar with every candle gleaming through soft shadows like a star but he listened listened listened with no thought of love or prayer for the swelling notes of triumph from his organ standing there all was silent nothing heard he save the priest s low monotone and the bride s robe trailing softly o er the floor of fretted stone then his lips grew white with anger surely god was pleased with him who had built the wondrous organ for his temple vast and dim whose the fault then hers the maiden standing meekly at his side flamed his jealous rage maintaining she was false to him his bride vain were all her protestations vain her innocence and truth on that very night he left her to her anguish and her ruth far he wandered to a country wherein no man knew his name for ten weary years he dwelt there nursing still his wrath and shame then his haughty heart grew softer and he thought by night and day of the bride he had deserted till he hardly dared to pray thought of her a spotless maiden fair and beautiful and good thought of his relentless anger that had cursed her womanhood till his yearning grief and penitence at last were all complete and he longed with bitter longing just to fall down at her feet ah how throbbed his heart when after many a weary day and night rose his native towers before him with the sunset glow alight through the gates into the city on he pressed with eager tread there he met a long procession mourners following the dead now why weep ye so good people and whom bury ye today why do yonder sorrowing maidens scatter flowers along the way has some saint gone up to heaven yes they answered weeping sore for the organ builder s saintly wife our eyes shall see no more and because her days were given to the service of god s poor from his church we mean to bury her see yonder is the door no one knew him no one wondered when he cried out white with pain no one questioned when with pallid lips he poured his tears like rain tis someone she has comforted who mourns with us they said as he made his way unchallenged and bore the coffin s head bore it through the open portal bore it up the echoing aisle let it down before the altar where the lights burned clear the while when oh hark the wondrous organ of itself began to play strains of rare unearthly sweetness never heard until that day all the vaulted arches rang with music sweet and clear all the air was filled with glory

crooked trail as all calves do since then three hundred years have fled and i infer the calf is dead but still he left behind his trail and thereby hangs a moral tale the trail was taken up next day by a lone dog that passed that way and then the wise bell wether sheep pursued the trail o er vale and steep and drew the flock behind him too as good bell wethers always do and from that day o er hill and glade through those old woods a path was made and many men wound in and out and turned and dodged and bent about and uttered words of righteous wrath because twas such a crooked path but still they followed do not laugh the first migrations of that calf and through this winding woodway stalked because he wabbled when he walked this forest path became a lane that bent and turned and turned again this crooked path became a road where many a poor horse with his load toiled on beneath the burning sun and traveled some three miles in one and thus a century and a half they trod the footsteps of that calf the years passed on in swiftness fleet the road became a village street and this before men were aware a city s crowded thoroughfare and soon the central street was this of a renowned metropolis and men two centuries and a half trod in the footsteps of that calf each day a hundred thousand rout followed the zigzag calf about and o er his crooked journey went the traffic of a continent a hundred thousand men were led by a calf near three centuries dead they followed still his crooked way and lost one hundred years a day for thus such reverence is lent to well established precedent a moral lesson this might teach were i ordained and called to preach for men are prone to go it blind along the calf paths of the mind and work away from sun to sun to do what other men have done they follow in the beaten track and out and in and forth and back and still their devious course pursue to keep the path that others do but how the wise wood gods must laugh who saw the first

on a spot as pretty as might be found in the dangerous length of the neutral ground in a cottage cozy and all their own she and her mother lived alone safe were the two with their frugal store from all of the many who passed their door for jennie s mother was strange to fears and jennie was large for fifteen years with vim her eyes were glistening her hair was the hue of a blackbird s wing and while the friends who knew her well the sweetness of her heart could tell a gun that hung on the kitchen wall looked solemnly quick to heed her call and they who were evil minded knew her nerve was strong and her aim was true so all kind words and acts did deal to generous black eyed jennie m neal one night when the sun had crept to bed and rain clouds lingered overhead and sent their surly drops for proof to drum a tune on the cottage roof close after a knock at the outer door there entered a dozen dragoons or more their red coats stained by the muddy road that they were british soldiers showed the captain his hostess bent to greet saying madam please give us a bit to eat we will pay you well and if may be this bright eyed girl for pouring our tea then we must dash ten miles ahead to catch a rebel colonel abed he is visiting home as doth appear we will make his pleasure cost him dear and they fell on the hasty supper with zeal close watched the while by jennie m neal for the gray haired colonel they hovered near had been her true friend kind and dear and oft in her younger days had he right proudly perched her upon his knee and told her stories many a one concerning the french war lately done and oft together the two friends were and many the arts he had taught to her she had hunted by his fatherly side he had shown her how to fence and ride and once had said the time may be your skill and courage may stand by me so sorrow for him she could but feel brave grateful hearted jennie m neal with never a thought or a moment more bare headed she slipped from the cottage door ran out where the horses were left to feed unhitched and mounted the captain s steed and down the hilly and rock strewn way she urged the fiery horse of gray around her slender and cloakless form pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm secure and tight a gloveless hand grasped the reins with stern command and full and black her long hair streamed whenever the ragged lightning gleamed and on she rushed for the colonel s weal brave lioness hearted jennie m neal hark from the hills a moment mute came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit and a cry from the foremost trooper said halt or your blood be on your head she heeded it not and not in vain she lashed the horse with the bridle rein so into the night the gray horse strode his shoes hewed fire from the rocky road and the high born courage that never dies flashed from his rider s coal black eyes the pebbles flew from the fearful race the raindrops grasped at her glowing face on on brave beast with loud appeal cried eager resolute jennie m neal halt once more came the voice of dread halt or your blood be on your head then no one answering to the calls sped after her a volley of balls they passed her in her rapid flight they screamed to her left they screamed to her right but rushing still o er the slippery track she sent no token of answer back except a silvery laughter peal brave merry hearted jennie m neal so on she rushed at her own good will through wood and valley o er plain and hill the gray horse did his duty well till all at once he stumbled and fell himself escaping the nets of harm but flinging the girl with a broken arm still undismayed by the numbing pain she clung to the horse s bridle rein and gently bidding him to stand petted him with her able hand then sprung again to the saddle bow and shouted one more trial now as if ashamed of the heedless fall he gathered his strength once more for all and galloping down a hillside steep gained on the troopers at every leap no more the high bred steed did reel but ran his best for jennie m neal they were a furlong behind or more when the girl burst through the colonel s door her poor arm helpless hanging with pain and she all drabbled and drenched with rain but her cheeks as red as fire brands are and her eyes as bright as a blazing star and shouted quick be quick i say they come they come away away then sunk on the rude white floor of deal poor brave exhausted jennie m neal the startled colonel sprung and pressed the wife and children to his breast and turned away from his fireside bright and glided into the stormy night then soon and safely made his way to where the patriot army lay but first he bent in the dim firelight and kissed the forehead broad and white and blessed the girl who had ridden so well to keep him out of a prison cell the girl roused up at the martial din just as the troopers came rushing in and laughed e en in the midst of a moan saying good sirs your bird has flown tis i who have scared him from his nest so deal with me now as you think best but the grand young captain bowed and said never you hold a moment s dread of womankind i must crown you queen so brave a girl i have never seen wear this gold ring as your valor s due and when peace comes i will come for you but jennie s face an arch smile wore as she said there s a lad in putnam s corps who told me the same long time ago you

tossing about like wrecks at sea with helm and anchor lost on and on through the surging waves nor caring to count the cost i doubt sometimes if the savior sees he seems so far away how the souls he loved and died for are drifting drifting astray indeed tis little wonder sir if woman shrinks and cries when the life blood on rum s altar spilled is calling to the skies small wonder if her own heart feels each sacrificial blow for isn t each life a part of hers each pain her hurt and woe read all the records of crime and shame tis bitterly sadly true where manliness and honor die there some woman

beneath him he stands now once and once only they cheer him a single tempestuous breath and there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness of death slow steadily mounting unheeding aught save the goal of the fire still higher and higher an atom he moves on the face of the spire he stops will he fall lo for answer a gleam like a meteor s track and hurled on the stones of the

remorse you never knew and again i tried to soothe him but my eyes o erbrimmed with tears his were dry and clear as brilliant as they were in college years all the flush had left his features he lay white as marble now tenderly i smoothed his pillow wiped the moisture from his brow though i begged him to be quiet he would talk of those old days brokenly at times but always of the boys with loving praise once i asked him of lorena the sweet girl whom he had wed you remember rena barstow when i asked if she were dead no he said his poor voice faltering she is far beyond the rhine but i wish to

benediction touched the people tenderly and they rose to face the sunset in the glowing lighted west and then hastened to their dwellings for god s blessed boon of rest bat they looked across the waters and a storm was raging there a fierce spirit moved above them the wild spirit of the air and it lashed and shook and tore them till they thundered groaned and boomed and alas for any vessel in their yawning gulfs entombed very anxious were the people on that rocky coast of wales lest the dawn of coming morrow should be telling awful tales when the sea had spent its passion and should cast upon the shore bits of wreck and swollen victims as it had done heretofore with the rough winds blowing round her a brave woman strained her eyes as she saw along the billows a large vessel fall and rise oh it did not need a prophet to tell what the end must be for no ship could ride in safety near that shore on such a sea then the pitying people hurried from their homes and thronged the beach oh for power to cross the waters and the perishing to reach helpless hands were wrung in terror tender hearts grew cold with dread and the ship urged by the tempest to the fatal rock shore sped she s parted in the middle oh the half of her goes down god have mercy is his heaven far to seek for those who drown lo when next the white shocked faces looked with terror on the sea only one last clinging figure on a spar was seen to be nearer to the trembling watchers came the wreck tossed by the wave and the man still clung and floated though no power on earth could save could we send him a short

hour of woe so he shouted through the trumpet look to jesus can you hear and aye aye sir rang the answer o er the waters loud and clear then they listened he is singing jesus lover of my soul and the winds brought back the echo while the nearer waters roll strange indeed it was to hear him till the storm of life is past singing bravely o er the waters oh receive my soul at last he could have no other refuge hangs my helpless soul on thee leave ah leave me not the singer dropped at last into the sea and the watchers looking homeward through their eyes by tears made dim said he passed to be

terrible edge there had slipped a duke and full many a peasant so the people said something would have to be done but their projects did not at all tally some said put a fence around the edge of the cliff some an ambulance down in the valley but the cry for the ambulance carried the day for it spread through the neighboring city a fence may be useful or not it is true but each heart became brimful of pity for those who slipped over that dangerous cliff and the dwellers in highway and alley gave pounds or gave pence not to put up a fence but an ambulance down in the valley for the cliff is all right if you re careful they said and if folks even slip and are dropping it isn t the slipping that hurts them so much as the shock down below when they re stopping so day after day as these mishaps occurred quick forth would these rescuers sally to pick up the victims who fell off the cliff with their ambulance down in the valley then an old sage remarked it s a marvel to me that people give far more attention to repairing results than to stopping the cause when they d much better aim at prevention let us stop at its source all this mischief cried he come neighbors and friends let us rally if the cliff we will fence we might almost dispense with the ambulance down in the valley oh he s a fanatic the others rejoined dispense with the ambulance never he d dispense with all charities too if he could no no we ll support them forever aren t we picking up folks just as fast as they fall and shall this man dictate to us shall he why should people of sense stop to put up a fence while the ambulance works in the valley but a sensible few who are practical too will not bear with such nonsense much longer they believe that prevention is better than cure and their party will soon be the stronger encourage them then with your purse voice and pen and while other philanthropists dally they will scorn all pretense and put up a stout fence on the cliff that hangs over the valley better guide well the young than reclaim them when old for the voice of true wisdom is calling to rescue the fallen is good but tis best to prevent other people from falling better close up the source of temptation and crime than deliver from dungeon or galley better put a strong fence round the top of the cliff than an ambulance down in the valley joseph malins ', 'the smack in school a district

pleasant talk along the briny beach we cannot do with more than four to give a hand to each the eldest oyster looked at him but never a word he said the eldest oyster winked his eye and shook his heavy head meaning to say he did not choose to leave the oyster bed but four young oysters hurried up all eager for the treat their coats were brushed their faces washed their shoes were clean and neat and this was odd because you know they hadn t any feet four other oysters followed them and yet another four and thick and fast they came at last and more and more and more all hopping through the frothy waves and scrambling to the shore the walrus and the carpenter walked on a mile or so and then they rested on a rock conveniently low and all the little oysters stood and waited in a row the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings but wait a bit the oysters cried before we have our chat for some of us are out of breath and all of us are fat no hurry said the carpenter they thanked him much for that a loaf of bread the walrus said is what we chiefly need pepper and vinegar besides are very good indeed now if you re ready oysters dear we can begin to feed but not on us the oysters cried turning a little blue after such kindness that would be a dismal thing to do the night is fine the walrus said do you admire the view it was so kind of you to come and you are very nice the carpenter said nothing but cut us another slice i wish you were not quite so deaf i ve had to ask you twice it seems a shame the walrus said to play them such a trick after we ve brought them out so far and made them trot so quick the carpenter said nothing but the butter s spread too thick i weep for you the walrus said i deeply sympathize with sobs and tears he sorted out those of the largest size holding his pocket handkerchief before his streaming eyes o oysters said the carpenter you ve had a pleasant run shall we be trotting home again but answer came there none and this was scarcely odd because they d eaten every one lewis carroll ', 'the teacher s dream the weary teacher sat alone while twilight gathered on and not a sound was heard around the boys and girls were gone the weary teacher sat alone unnerved and pale was he bowed neath a yoke of care he spoke in sad soliloquy another round another round of labor thrown away another chain of toil and pain dragged through a tedious day of no avail is constant zeal love s sacrifice is lost the hopes of morn so golden turn each evening into dross i squander on a barren field my strength my life my all the seeds i sow will never grow they perish where they fall he sighed and low upon his hands his aching brow he pressed and o er his frame ere long there came a soothing sense of rest and then he lifted up his face but started back aghast the room by strange and sudden change assumed proportions vast it seemed a senate hall and one addressed a listening throng each burning word all bosoms stirred applause rose loud and long the wildered teacher thought he knew the speaker s voice and look and for his name said he the same is in my record book the stately senate hall dissolved a church rose in its place wherein there stood a man of god dispensing words of grace and though he spoke in solemn tone and though his hair was gray the teacher s thought was strangely wrought i whipped that boy to day the church a phantom vanished soon what saw the teacher then in classic gloom of alcoved room an author plied his pen my idlest lad the teacher said filled with a new surprise shall i behold his name enrolled among the great and wise the vision of a cottage home the teacher now descried a mother

watching each white cloudlet float silently and slow you think a piece of heaven lies on our earth below midnight is there and silence enthroned in heaven looks down upon her own calm mirror upon a sleeping town for bregenz that quaint city upon the tyrol shore has stood above lake constance a thousand years and more her battlement and towers from off their rocky steep have cast their trembling shadow for ages on the deep mountain and lake and valley a sacred legend know of how the town was saved one night three hundred years ago far from her home and kindred a tyrol maid had fled to serve in the swiss valleys and toil for daily bread and every year that fleeted so silently and fast seemed to bear farther from her the memory of the past she served kind gentle masters nor asked for rest or change her friends seemed no more new ones their speech seemed no more strange and when she led her cattle to pasture every day she ceased to look and wonder on which side bregenz lay she spoke no more of bregenz with longing and with tears her tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of years she heeded not the rumors of austrian war and strife each day she rose contented to the calm toils of life yet when her master s children would clustering round her stand she sang them ancient ballads of her own native land and when at morn and evening she knelt before god s throne the accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone and so she dwelt the valley more peaceful year by year when suddenly strange portents of some great deed seemed near the golden corn was bending upon its fragile stock while farmers heedless of their fields paced up and down in talk the men seemed stern and altered with looks cast on the ground with anxious faces one by one the women gathered round all talk of flax or spinning or work was put away the very children seemed afraid to go alone to play one day out in the meadow with strangers from the town some secret plan discussing the men walked up and down yet now and then seemed watching a strange uncertain gleam that looked like lances mid the trees that stood below the stream at eve they all assembled then care and doubt were fled with jovial laugh they feasted the board was nobly spread the elder of the village rose up his glass in hand and cried we drink the downfall of an accursed land the night is growing darker ere one more day is flown bregenz our foeman s stronghold bregenz shall be our own the women shrank in terror yet pride too had her part but one poor tyrol maiden felt death within her heart before her stood fair bregenz once more her towers arose what were the friends beside her only her country s foes the faces of her kinsfolk the days of childhood flown the echoes of her mountains reclaimed her as their own nothing she heard around her though shouts rang forth again gone were the green swiss valleys the pasture and the plain before her eyes one vision and in her heart one cry that said go forth save bregenz and then if need be die with trembling haste and breathless with noiseless step she sped horses and weary cattle were standing in the shed she loosed the strong white charger that fed from out her hand she mounted and she turned his head towards her native land out out into the darkness faster and still more fast the smooth grass flies behind her the chestnut wood is past she looks up clouds are heavy why is her steed so slow scarcely the wind beside them can pass them as they go faster she cries oh faster eleven the church bells chime o god she cries help bregenz and bring me there in time but louder than bells ringing or lowing of the kine grows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the rhine shall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop check the steed draws back in terror she leans upon his neck to watch the flowing darkness the bank is high and steep one pause he staggers forward and plunges in the deep she strives to pierce the blackness and looser throws the rein her steed must breast the waters that dash above his mane how gallantly how nobly he struggles through the foam and see in the far distance shine out the lights of home up the steep bank he bears her and now they rush again toward the heights of bregenz that tower above the plain they reach the gate of bregenz just as the midnight rings and out come serf and soldier to meet the news she brings bregenz is saved ere daylight her battlements are manned defiance greets the army that marches on the land and if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid bregenz does well to honor the noble tyrol maid three hundred years are vanished and yet upon the hill an old stone gateway rises to do her honor still and there when bregenz women sit spinning in the shade they see in quaint old carving the charger and

merrily she said you marry saucy brier rose the man he is not found to marry such a worthless wench these seven leagues around but brier rose she laughed and she trilled a merry lay perhaps he ll come my mother dear from eight leagues away the good wife with a humph and a sigh forsook the battle and flung her pots and pails about with much vindictive rattle o lord what sin did i commit in youthful days and wild that thou hast punished me in age with such a wayward child up stole the girl on tiptoe so that none her step could hear and laughing pressed an airy kiss behind the good wife s ear and she as e er relenting sighed oh heaven only knows whatever will become of you my naughty brier rose the sun was high and summer sounds were teeming in the air the clank of scythes the cricket s whir and swelling woodnotes rare from fields and copse and meadow and through the open door sweet fragrant whiffs of new mown hay the idle breezes bore then brier rose grew pensive like a bird of thoughtful mien whose little life has problems among the branches green she heard the river brawling where the tide was swift and strong she heard the summer singing its strange alluring song and out she skipped the meadows o er and gazed into the sky her heart o erbrimmed with gladness she scarce herself knew why and to a merry tune she hummed oh heaven only knows whatever will become of the naughty brier rose whene er a thrifty matron this idle maid espied she shook her head in warning and scarce her wrath could hide for girls were made for housewives for spinning wheel and loom and not to drink the sunshine and wild flower s sweet perfume and oft the maidens cried when the brier rose went by you cannot knit a stocking and you cannot make a pie but brier rose as was her wont she cocked her curly head but i can sing a pretty song full merrily she said and oft the young lads shouted when they saw the maid at play ho good for nothing brier rose how do you do to day then she shook her tiny fist to her cheeks the color flew however much you coax me i ll never dance with you thus flew the years light winged over brier rose s head till she was twenty summers old and yet remained unwed and all the parish wondered the lord almighty knows whatever will become of that naughty brier rose and while they wondered came the spring a dancing o er the hills her breath was warmer than of yore and all the mountain rills with their tinkling and their rippling and their rushing filled the air and the misty sounds of water forth welling everywhere and in the valley s depth like a lusty beast of prey the river leaped and roared aloud and tossed its mane of spray then hushed again its voice to a softly plashing croon as dark it rolled beneath the sun and white beneath the moon it was a merry sight to see the lumber as it whirled adown the tawny eddies that hissed and seethed and swirled now shooting through the rapids and with a reeling swing into the foam crests diving like an animated thing but in the narrows of the rocks where o er a steep incline the waters plunged and wreathed in foam the dark boughs of the pine the lads kept watch with shout and song and sent each straggling beam a spinning down the rapids lest it should lock the stream and yet methinks i hear it now wild voices in the night a rush of feet a dog s harsh bark a torch s flaring light and wandering gusts of dampness and round us far and nigh a throbbing boom of water like a pulse beat in the sky the dawn just pierced the pallid east with spears of gold and red as we with boat hooks in our hands toward the narrows sped and terror smote us for we heard the mighty tree tops sway and thunder as of chariots and hissing showers of spray now lads the sheriff shouted you are strong like norway s rock a hundred crowns i give to him who breaks the lumber lock for if another hour go by the angry waters spoil our homes will be and fields and our weary years of toil we looked each at the other each hoped his neighbor would brave death and danger for his home as valiant norsemen should but at our feet the brawling tide expanded like a lake and whirling beams came shooting on and made the firm rock quake two hundred crowns the sheriff cried and breathless stood the crowd two hundred crowns my bonny lads in anxious tones and loud but not a man came forward and no one spoke or stirred and nothing save the thunder of the cataract was heard but as with trembling hands and with fainting hearts we stood we spied a little curly head emerging from the wood we heard a little snatch of a merry little song and saw the dainty brier rose come dancing through the throng an angry murmur rose from the people round about fling her into the river we heard the matrons shout chase her away the silly thing for god himself scarce knows why ever he created that worthless brier rose sweet brier rose she heard their cries a little pensive smile across her fair face flitted that might a stone beguile and then she gave her pretty head a roguish little cock hand me a boat hook lads she said i think i ll break the lock derisive shouts of laughter broke from throats of young and old ho good for nothing brier rose your tongue was ever bold and mockingly a boat hook into her hands was flung when lo into the river s midst with daring leaps she sprung we saw her dimly through a mist of dense and blinding spray from beam to beam she skipped like a water sprite at play and now and then faint gleams we caught of color through the mist a crimson waist a golden head a little dainty wrist in terror pressed the people to the margin of the hill a hundred breaths were bated a hundred hearts stood still for hark from out the rapids came a strange and creaking sound and then a crash of thunder which shook the very ground the waters hurled the lumber mass down o er the rocky steep we heard a muffled rumbling and a rolling in the deep we saw a tiny form which the torrent swiftly bore and flung into the wild abyss where it was seen no more ah little naughty brier rose thou couldst not weave nor spin yet thou couldst do a nobler deed than all thy mocking kin for thou hadst courage e en to die and by thy death to save a thousand farms and lives from the fury of the wave and yet the adage lives in the valley of thy birth when wayward children spend their days in

of pope urbane and valmond emperor of allemaine appareled in magnificent attire with retinue of many a knight and squire on st john s eve at vespers proudly sat and heard the priests chant the magnificat and as he listened o er and o er again repeated like a burden or refrain he caught the words deposuit potentes de sede et exaltavit humiles and slowly lifting up his kingly head he to a learned clerk beside him said what mean those words the clerk made answer meet he has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted them of low degree thereat king robert muttered scornfully tis well that such seditious words are sung only by priests and in the latin tongue for unto priests and people be it known there is no power can push me from my throne and leaning back he yawned and fell asleep lulled by the chant monotonous and deep when he awoke it was already night the church was empty and there was no light save where the lamps that glimmered few and faint lighted a little space before some saint he started from his seat and gazed around but saw no living thing and heard no sound he groped towards the door but it was locked he cried aloud and listened and then knocked and uttered awful threatenings and complaints and imprecations upon men and saints the sounds re echoed from the roof and walls as if dead priests were laughing in their stalls at length the sexton hearing from without the tumult of the knocking and the shout and thinking thieves were in the house of prayer came with his lantern asking who is there half choked with rage king robert fiercely said open tis i the king art thou afraid the frightened sexton muttering with a curse this is some drunken vagabond or worse turned the great key and flung the portal wide a man rushed by him at a single stride haggard half naked without hat or cloak who neither turned nor looked at him nor spoke but leaped into the blackness of the night and vanished like a spectre from his sight robert of sicily brother of pope urbane and valmond emperor of allemaine despoiled of his magnificent attire bare headed breathless and besprent with mire with sense of wrong and outrage desperate strode on and thundered at the palace gate rushed through the court yard thrusting in his rage to right and left each seneschal and page and hurried up the broad and sounding stair his white face ghastly in the torches glare from hall to hall he passed with breathless speed voices and cries he heard but did not heed until at last he reached the banquet room blazing with light and breathing with perfume there on the dais sat another king wearing his robes his crown his signet ring king robert s self in features form and height but all transfigured with angelic light it was an angel and his presence there with a divine effulgence filled the air an exaltation piercing the disguise though none the hidden angel recognize a moment speechless motionless amazed the throneless monarch on the angel gazed who met his look of anger and surprise with the divine compassion of his eyes then said who art thou and why com st thou here to which king robert answered with a sneer i am the king and come to claim my own from an impostor who usurps my throne and suddenly at these audacious words up sprang the angry guests and drew their swords the angel answered with unruffled brow nay not the king but the king s jester thou henceforth shalt wear the bells and scalloped cape and for thy counselor shalt lead an ape thou shalt obey my servants when they call and wait upon my henchmen in the hall deaf to king robert s threats and cries and prayers they thrust him from the hall and down the stairs a group of tittering pages ran before and as they opened wide the folding door his heart failed for he heard with strange alarms the boisterous laughter of the men at arms and all the vaulted chamber roar and ring with the mock plaudits of long live the king next morning waking with the day s first beam he said within himself it was a dream but the straw rustled as he turned his head there were the cap and bells beside his bed around him rose the bare discolored walls close by the steeds were champing in their stalls and in the corner a revolting shape shivering and chattering sat the wretched ape it was no dream the world he loved so much had turned to dust and ashes at his touch days came and went and now returned again to sicily the old saturnian reign under the angel s governance benign the happy island danced with corn and wine and deep within the mountain s burning breast enceladus the giant was at rest meanwhile king robert yielded to his fate sullen and silent and disconsolate dressed in the motley garb that jesters wear with look bewildered and a vacant stare close shaven above the ears as monks are shorn by courtiers mocked by pages laughed to scorn his only friend the ape his only food what others left he still was unsubdued and when the angel met him on his way and half in earnest half in jest would say sternly though tenderly that he might feel the velvet scabbard held a sword of steel art thou the king the passion of his woe burst from him in resistless overflow and lifting high his forehead he would fling the haughty answer back i am i am the king almost three years were ended when there came ambassadors of great repute and name from valmond emperor of allemaine unto king robert saying that pope urbane by letter summoned them forthwith to come on holy thursday to his city of rome the angel with great joy received his guests and gave them presents of embroidered vests and velvet mantles with rich ermine lined and rings and jewels of the rarest kind then he departed with them o er the sea into the lovely land of italy whose loveliness was more resplendent made by the mere passing of that cavalcade with plumes and cloaks and housings and the stir of jeweled bridle and of golden spur and lo among the menials in mock state upon a piebald steed with shambling gait his cloak of foxtails flapping in the wind the solemn ape demurely perched behind king robert rode making huge merriment in all the country towns through which they went the pope received them with great pomp and blare of bannered trumpets on st peter s square giving his benediction and embrace fervent and full of apostolic grace while with congratulations and with prayers he entertained the angel unawares robert the jester bursting through the crowd into their presence rushed and cried aloud i am the king look and behold in me robert your brother king of sicily this man who wears my semblance to your eyes is an impostor in a king s disguise do you not know me does no voice within answer my cry and say we are akin the pope in silence but with troubled mien gazed at the angel s countenance serene the emperor laughing said it is strange sport to keep a mad man for thy fool at court and the poor baffled jester in disgrace was hustled back among the populace in solemn state the holy week went by and easter sunday gleamed upon the sky the presence of the angel with its light before the sun rose made the city bright and with new fervor filled the hearts of men who felt that christ indeed had risen again even the jester on his bed of straw with haggard eyes the unwonted splendor saw he felt within a power unfelt before and kneeling humbly on his chamber floor he heard the rustling garments of the lord sweep through the silent air ascending heavenward and now the visit ending and once more valmond returning to the danube s shore homeward the angel journeyed and again the land was made resplendent with his train flashing along the towns of italy unto salerno and from thence by sea and when once more within palermo s wall and seated on the throne in his great hall he heard the angelus from convent towers as if the better world conversed with ours he beckoned to king robert to draw nigher and with a gesture bade the rest retire and when they were alone the angel said art thou the king then bowing down his head king robert crossed both hands upon his breast and meekly answered him thou knowest best my sins as scarlet are let me go hence and in some cloister s school of penitence across those stones that pave the way to heaven walk barefoot till my guilty soul be shriven the angel smiled and from his radiant face a holy light illumined all the place and through the open window loud and clear they heard the monks chant in the chapel near above the stir and tumult of the street he has put down the mighty from their seat and has exalted them of low degree and through the chant a second melody rose like the throbbing of a single string i am an angel and thou art the king king robert who was standing near the throne lifted his eyes and lo he was alone but all appareled as in days of old with ermined mantle and with cloth of gold and when his courtiers came they found him there kneeling upon the floor absorbed in silent prayer h w longfellow ', 'the huskers it was late in mild october and the long autumnal rain had left the summer harvest fields all green with grass again the first sharp frosts had fallen leaving all the woodlands gay with the hues of summer s rainbow or the meadow flowers of may through a thin dry mist that morning the sun rose broad and red at first a rayless disk of fire he brightened as he sped yet even his noontide glory fell chastened and subdued on the cornfields and the orchards and softly pictured wood and all that quiet afternoon slow sloping to the night he wove with golden shuttle the haze with yellow light slanting through the painted beeches he glorified the hill and beneath it pond and meadow lay brighter greener still and shouting boys in woodland haunts caught glimpses of that sky flecked by the many tinted leaves and laughed they knew not why and schoolgirls gay with aster flowers beside the meadow brooks mingled the glow of autumn with the sunshine of sweet looks from spire and ball looked westerly the patient weathercock but even the birches on the hill stood motionless as rocks no sound was in the woodlands save the squirrel s dropping shell and the yellow leaves among the boughs low rustling as they fell the summer grains were harvested the stubble fields lay dry where june winds rolled in light and shade the pale green waves of rye but still on gentle hill slopes in valleys fringed with wood ungathered bleaching in the sun the heavy corn crop stood bent low by autumn s wind and rain through husks that dry and sere unfolded by their ripened charge shone out the yellow ear beneath the turnip lay concealed in many a verdant fold and glistened in the slanting light the pumpkin s sphere of gold there wrought the busy harvesters and many a creaking wain bore slowly to the long barn floor its load of husk and grain till broad and red as when he rose the sun sank down at last and like a merry guest s farewell the day in brightness passed and lo as through the western pines on meadow stream and pond flamed the red radiance of a sky set all afire beyond slowly o er the eastern sea bluffs a milder glory shone and the sunset and the moonrise were mingled into one as thus into the quiet night the twilight lapsed away and deeper in the brightening moon the tranquil shadows lay from many a brown old farm house and hamlet without name their milking and their home tasks done the merry huskers came swung o er the heaped up harvest from pitchforks in the mow shone dimly down the lanterns on the pleasant scene below the growing pile of husks behind the golden ears before and laughing eyes and busy hands and brown cheeks glimmering o er half hidden in a quiet nook serene of look and heart talking their old times over the old men sat apart while up and down the unhusked pile or nestling in its shade at hide and seek with laugh and shout the happy children played urged by the good host s daughter a maiden young and fair

as once all i can say is that s a sign he never would do for a hero of mine an aspiring genius was d green the son of a farmer age fourteen his body was long and lank and lean just right for flying as will be seen he had two eyes each bright as a bean and a freckled nose that grew between a little awry for i must mention that he had riveted his attention upon his wonderful invention twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings working his face as he worked the wings and with every turn of gimlet and screw turning and screwing his mouth round too till his nose seemed bent to catch the scent around some corner of new baked pies and his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes grew puckered into a queer grimace that made him look very droll in the face and also very wise and wise he must have been to do more than ever a genius did before excepting daedalus of yore and his son icarus who wore upon their backs those wings of wax he had read of in the old almanacs darius was clearly of the opinion that the air is also man s dominion and that with paddle or fin or pinion we soon or late shall navigate the azure as now we sail the sea the thing looks simple enough to me and if you

sitting cross legged like a turk drawing the waxed end through with a jerk and boring the holes with a comical quirk of his wise old head and a knowing smirk but vainly they mounted each other s backs and poked through knot holes and pried through cracks with wood from the pile and straw from the stacks he plugged the knot holes and calked the cracks and a bucket of water which one would think he had brought up into the loft to drink when he chanced to be dry stood always nigh for darius was sly and whenever at work he happened to spy at chink or crevice a blinking eye he let a dipper of water

while there is light to see to the hut of the blind old man who lives across the dike for me and take these cakes i made for him they are hot and smoking yet you have time enough to go and come before the sun is set then the good wife turned to her labor humming a simple song and thought of her husband working hard at the sluices all day long and set the turf a blazing and brought the coarse black bread that he might find a fire at night and find the table spread and peter left the brother with whom all day he had played and the sister who had watched their sports in the willow s tender shade and told them they d see him back before they saw a star in sight though he wouldn t be afraid to go in the very darkest night for he was a brave bright fellow with eye and conscience clear he could do whatever a boy might do and he had not learned to fear why he wouldn t have robbed a bird s nest nor brought a stork to harm though never a law in holland had stood to stay his arm and now with his face all glowing and eyes as bright as the day with the thoughts of his pleasant errand he trudged along the way and soon his joyous prattle made glad a lonesome place alas if only the blind old man could have seen that happy face yet he somehow caught the brightness which his voice and presence lent and he felt the sunshine come and go as peter came and went and now as the day was sinking and the winds began to rise the mother looked from her door again shading her anxious eyes and saw the shadows deepen and birds to their homes come back but never a sign of peter along the level track but she said he will come at morning so i need not fret nor grieve though it isn t like my boy at all to stay without my leave but where was the child delaying on the homeward way was he across the dike

that the gates are good and strong and my father tends them carefully or they would not hold you long you re a wicked sea said peter i know why you fret and chafe you would like to spoil our lands and homes but our sluices keep you safe but hark through the noise of waters comes a low clear trickling sound and the child s face pales with terror and his blossoms drop to the ground he is up the bank in a moment and stealing through the sand he sees a stream not yet so large as his slender childish hand tis a leak in the dike he is but a boy unused to fearful scenes but young as he is he has learned to know the dreadful thing that means a leak in the dike the stoutest heart grows faint that cry to hear and the bravest man in all the land turns white with mortal fear for he knows the smallest leak may grow to a flood in a single night and he knows the strength of the cruel sea when loosed in its angry might and the boy he has seen the danger and shouting a wild alarm he forces back the weight of the sea with the strength of his single arm he listens for the joyful sound of a footstep passing nigh and lays his ear to the ground to catch the answer to his cry and he hears the rough winds blowing and the waters rise and fall but never an answer comes to him save the echo of his call he sees no hope no succor his feeble voice is lost yet what shall he do but watch and wait though he perish at his post so faintly calling and crying till the sun is under the sea crying and moaning till the stars come out for company he thinks of his brother and sister asleep in their safe warm bed he thinks of his father and mother of himself as dying and dead and of how when the night is over they must come and find him at last but he never thinks he can leave the place where duty holds him fast the good dame in the cottage is up and astir with the light for the thought of her little peter has been with her all night and now she watches the pathway as yester eve she had done but what does she see so strange and black against the rising sun her neighbors are bearing between them something straight to her door her child is coming home but not as he ever came before he is dead she cries my darling and the startled father hears and comes and looks the way she looks and fears the thing she fears till a glad shout from the bearers thrills the stricken man and wife give

since then but still when the sea roars like a flood their boys are taught what a boy can do who is brave and true and good for every man in that country takes his son by the hand and tells him of

hurried not a soldier discharged his farewell shot o er the grave where our hero we buried we buried him darkly at dead of night the sods with our bayonets turning by struggling moonbeam s misty light and the lantern dimly burning no useless coffin enclosed his breast nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him but he lay like a warrior taking his rest with his martial cloak around him few and short were the prayers we said and we spoke not a word of sorrow but we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead and we bitterly thought of the morrow we thought as we hollowed his narrow bed and smoothed down his lonely pillow that the foe and the stranger would tread o er his head and we far away on the billow lightly they ll talk of the spirit that s gone and o er his cold ashes upbraid him but little he ll reck if they let him sleep on in the grave where a briton has laid him but half of our heavy task was done when the clock tolled the hour for retiring and we heard the distant and random gun that the foe was sullenly firing slowly and sadly we laid him down from the field of his fame fresh and gory we carved not a line and we raised not a stone but we left him alone with his glory

day and year he said to his friend if the british march by land or sea from the town tonight hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch of the north church tower as a signal light one if by land and two if by sea and i on the opposite shore will be ready to ride and spread the alarm through every middlesex village and farm for the country folk to be up and to arm then he said good night and with muffled oar silently rowed to the charlestown shore just as the moon rose over the bay where swinging wide at her moorings lay the somerset british man of war a phantom ship with each mast and spar across the moon like a prison bar and a huge black hulk that was magnified by its own reflection in the tide meanwhile his friend through alley and street wanders and watches with eager ears till in the silence around him he hears the muster of men at the barrack door the sound of arms and the tramp of feet and the measured tread of the grenadiers marching down to their boats on the shore then he climbed to the tower of the old north church by the wooden stairs with stealthy tread to the belfry chamber overhead and startled the pigeons from their perch on the sombre rafters that round him made masses and moving shapes of shade by the trembling ladder steep and tall to the highest window in the wall where he paused to listen and look down a moment on the roofs of the town and the moonlight flowing over all beneath in the churchyard lay the dead in their night encampment on the hill wrapped in silence so deep and still that he could hear like a sentinel s tread the watchful night wind as it went creeping along from tent to tent and seeming to whisper all is well a moment only he feels the spell of the place and hour and the secret dread of the lonely belfry and the dead for suddenly all his thoughts are bent on a shadowy something far away where the river widens to meet the bay a line of black that bends and floats on the rising tide like a bridge of boats meanwhile impatient to mount and ride booted and spurred with a heavy stride on the opposite shore walked paul revere now he patted his horse s side now gazed on the landscape far and near then impetuous stamped the earth and turned and tightened his saddle girth but mostly he watched with eager search the belfry tower of the old north church as it rose above the graves on the hill lonely and spectral and sombre and still and lo as he looks on the belfry s height a glimmer and then a gleam of light he springs to the saddle the bridle he turns but lingers and gazes till full on his sight a second lamp in the belfry burns a harry of hoofs in a village street a shape in the moonlight a bulk in the dark and beneath from the pebbles in passing a spark struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet that was all and yet through the gloom and the light the fate of a nation was riding that night and the spark struck out by that steed in his flight kindled the land into flame with its heat he has left the village and mounted the steep and beneath him tranquil and broad and deep is the mystic meeting the ocean tides and under the alders that skirt its edge now soft on the sand now loud on the ledge is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides it was twelve by the village clock when he crossed the bridge into medford town he heard the crowing of the cock and the barking of the farmer s dog and felt the damp of the river fog that rises after the sun goes down it was one by the village clock when he galloped into lexington he saw the gilded weathercock swim in the moonlight as he passed and the meeting house windows blank and bare gaze at him with a spectral glare as if they already stood aghast at the bloody work they would look upon it was two by the village clock when he came to the bridge in concord town he heard the bleating of the flock and the twittering of birds among the trees and felt the breath of the morning breeze blowing over the meadows brown and one was safe and asleep in his bed who at the bridge would be first to fall who that day would be lying dead pierced by a british musket ball you know the rest in the books you have read how the british regulars fired and fled how the farmers gave them ball for ball from behind each fence and farmyard wall chasing the red coats down the lane then crossing the fields to emerge again under the trees at the turn of the road and only pausing to fire and load so through the night rode paul revere and so through the night went his cry of alarm to every middlesex village and farm a cry of defiance and not of fear a voice in the darkness a knock at the door and a word that shall echo forever more for borne on the night wind of the past through all our history to the last in the hour of darkness and peril and need

old splendid artist king the sun torn down and dragged in civilization s gutter or sold to purchase settlers bread and butter she don t want things exposed from porch to closet and so she kind o nags the man who does it she carries in her pockets bags of seeds as general agent of the thriftiest weeds she sends her blackbirds in the early morn to superintend his fields of planted corn she gives him rain past any duck s desire then maybe several weeks of quiet fire she sails mosquitoes leeches perched on wings to poison him with blood devouring stings she loves her ague muscle to display and shake him up say every other day with thoughtful conscientious care she makes those travelin poison bottles rattlesnakes she finds time mongst her other family cares to keep in stock good wild cats wolves and bears well when i first infested this retreat things to my view looked frightful incomplete but i had come with heart thrift in my song and brought my wife and plunder right along i hadn t a round trip ticket to go back and if i had there wasn t no railroad track and drivin east was what i couldn t endure i hadn t started on a circular tour my girl wife was as brave as she was good and helped me every blessed way she could she seemed to take to every rough old tree as sing lar as when first she took to me she kep our little log house neat as wax and once i caught her fooling with my axe she learned a hundred masculine things to do she aimed a shot gun pretty middlin true although in spite of my express desire she always shut her eyes before she d fire she hadn t the muscle though she had the heart in out door work to take an active part though in our firm of duty and endeavor she wasn t no silent partner whatsoever when i was logging burning choppin wood she d linger round and help me all she could and keep me fresh ambitious all the while and lifted tons just with her voice and smile with no desire my glory for to rob she used to stan around and boss the job and when first class success my hands befell would proudly say we did that pretty well she was delicious both to hear and see that pretty wife girl that kep house for me well neighborhoods meant counties in those days the roads didn t have accommodating ways and maybe weeks would pass before she d see and much less talk with any one but me the indians sometimes showed their sun baked faces but they didn t teem with conversational graces some ideas from the birds and trees she stole but twasn t like talking with a human soul and finally i thought that i could trace a half heart hunger peering from her face then she would drive it back and shut the door of course that only made me see it more twas hard to see her give her life to mine making a steady effort not to pine twas hard to hear that laugh bloom out each minute and recognize the seeds of sorrow in it no misery makes a close observer mourn like hopeless grief with hopeful courage borne there s nothing sets the sympathies to paining like a complaining woman uncomplaining it always draws my breath out into sighs to see a brave look in a woman s eyes well she went on as plucky as could be fighting the foe she thought i did not see and using her heart horticultural powers to turn that forest to a bed of flowers you cannot check an unadmitted sigh and so i had to soothe her on the sly and secretly to help her draw her load and soon it came to be an up hill road hard work bears hard upon the average pulse even with satisfactory results but when effects are scarce the heavy strain falls dead and solid on the heart and brain and when we re bothered it will oft occur we seek blame timber and i lit on her and looked at her with daily lessening favor for what i knew she couldn t help to save her and discord when he once had called and seen us came round quite often and edged in between us one night when i came home unusual late too hungry and too tired to feel first rate her supper struck me wrong though i ll allow she hadn t much to strike with anyhow and when i went to milk the cows and found they d wandered from their usual feeding ground and maybe d left a few long miles behind em which i must copy if i meant to find em flash quick the stay chains of my temper broke and in a trice these hot words i had spoke you ought to ve kept the animals in view and drove em in you d nothing else to do the heft of all our life on me must fall you just lie round and let me do it all that speech it hadn t been gone a half a minute before i saw the cold black poison in it and i d have given all i had and more to ve only safely got it back in door i m now what most folks well to do would call i feel to day as if i d give it all provided i through fifty years might reach and kill and bury that half minute speech she handed back no words as i could hear she didn t frown she didn t shed a tear half proud half crushed she stood and looked me o er like some one she had never seen before but such a sudden anguish lit surprise i never viewed before in human eyes i ve seen it oft enough since in a dream it sometimes wakes me like a midnight scream next morning when stone faced but heavy hearted with dinner pail and sharpened axe i started away for my day s work she watched the door and followed me half way to it or more and i was just a turning round at this and asking for my usual good by kiss but on her lip i saw a proudish curve and in her eye a shadow of reserve and she had shown perhaps half unawares some little independent breakfast airs and so the usual parting didn t occur although her eyes invited me to her or rather half invited me for she didn t advertise to furnish kisses free you always had that is i had to pay full market price and go more n half the way so with a short good by i shut the door and left her as i never had before but when at noon my lunch i came to eat put up by her so delicately neat choicer somewhat than yesterday s had been and some fresh sweet eyed pansies she d put in tender and pleasant thoughts i knew they meant it seemed as if her kiss with me she d sent then i became once more her humble lover and said to night i ll ask forgiveness of her i went home over early on that eve having contrived to make myself believe by various signs i kind o knew and guessed a thunder storm was coming from the west tis strange when one sly reason fills the heart how many honest ones will take its part a dozen first class reasons said twas right that i should strike home early on that night half out of breath the cabin door i swung with tender heart words trembling on my tongue but all within looked desolate and bare my house had lost its soul she was not there a penciled note was on the table spread and these are something like the words it said the cows have strayed away again i fear i watched them pretty close don t scold me dear and where they are i think i nearly know i heard the bell not very long ago i ve hunted for them all the afternoon i ll try once more i think i ll find them soon dear if a burden i have been to you and haven t helped you as i ought to do let old time memories my forgiveness plead i ve tried to do my best i have indeed darling piece out with love the strength i lack and have kind words for me when i get back scarce did i give this letter sight and tongue some swift blown rain drops to the window clung and from the clouds a rough deep growl proceeded my thunder storm had come now twasn t needed i rushed out door the air was stained with black night had come early on the storm cloud s back and everything kept dimming to the sight save when the clouds threw their electric light when for a flash so clean cut was the view i d think i saw her knowing twas not true through my small clearing dashed wide sheets of spray as if the ocean waves had lost their way scarcely a pause the thunder battle made in the bold clamor of its cannonade and she while i was sheltered dry and warm was somewhere in the clutches of this storm she who when storm frights found her at her best had always hid her white face on my breast my dog who d skirmished round me all the day now crouched and whimpering in a corner lay i dragged him by the collar to the wall i pressed his quivering muzzle to a shawl track her old boy i shouted and he whined matched eyes with me as if to read my mind then with a yell went tearing through the wood i followed him as faithful as i could no pleasure trip was that through flood and flame we raced with death we hunted noble game all night we dragged the woods without avail the ground got drenched we could not keep the trail three times again my cabin home i found half hoping she might be there safe and sound but each time twas an unavailing care my house had lost its soul she was not there when climbing the wet trees next morning sun laughed at the ruin that the night had done bleeding and drenched by toil and sorrow bent back to what used to be my home i went but as i neared our little clearing ground listen i heard the cow bell s tinkling sound the cabin door was just a bit ajar it gleamed upon my glad eyes like a star brave heart i said for such a fragile form she made them guide her homeward through the storm such pangs of joy i never felt before you ve come i shouted and rushed through the door yes she had come and gone again she lay with all her young life crushed and wrenched away lay the heart ruins of oar home among not far from where i killed her with my tongue the rain drops glittered mid her hair s long strands the forest thorns had torn her feet and hands and midst the tears brave tears that one could trace upon the pale but sweetly resolute face i once again the mournful words could read i have tried to do my best i have indeed and now i m mostly done my story s o er part of it never breathed the air before tisn t over usual it must be allowed to volunteer heart history to a crowd and scatter mongst them confidential tears but you

meadow sweet with hay beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth of simple beauty and rustic health singing she wrought and her merry glee the mock bird echoed from his tree but when she glanced to the far off town white from its hill slope looking down the sweet song died and a vague unrest and a nameless longing filled her breast a wish that she hardly dared to own for something better than she had known the judge rode slowly down the lane smoothing his horse s chestnut mane he drew his bridle in the shade of the apple trees to greet the maid and asked a draught from the spring that flowed through the meadow across the road she stooped where the cool spring bubbled up and filled for him her small tin cup and blushed as she gave it looking down on her feet so bare and her tattered gown thanks said the judge a sweeter draught from a fairer hand was never quaffed he spoke of the grass and flowers and trees of the singing birds and the humming bees then talked of the haying and wondered whether the cloud in the west would bring foul weather and maud forgot her brier torn gown and her graceful ankles bare and brown and listened while a pleased surprise looked from her long lashed hazel eyes at last like one who for delay seeks a vain excuse he rode away maud muller looked and sighed ah me that i the judge s bride might be he would dress me up in silks so fine and praise and toast me at his wine my father should wear a broadcloth coat my brother should sail a painted boat i d dress my mother so grand and gay and the baby should have a new toy each day and i d feed the hungry and clothe the poor and all should bless me who left our door the judge looked back as he climbed the hill and saw maud muller standing still a form more fair a face more sweet ne er hath it been my lot to meet and her modest answer and graceful air show her wise and good as she is fair would she were mine and i to day like her a harvester of hay no doubtful balance of rights and wrongs nor weary lawyers with endless tongues but low of cattle and song of birds and health and quiet and loving words but he thought of his sisters proud and cold and his mother vain of her rank and gold so closing his heart the judge rode on and maud was left in the field alone but the lawyers smiled that afternoon when he hummed in court an old love tune and the young girl mused beside the well till the rain on the unraked clover fell he wedded a wife of richest dower who lived for fashion as he for power yet oft in his marble hearth s bright glow he watched a picture come and go and sweet maud muller s hazel eyes looked out in their innocent surprise oft when the wine in his glass was red he longed for the wayside well instead and closed his eyes on his garnished rooms to dream of meadows and clover blooms and the proud man sighed with a secret pain ah that i were free again free as when i rode that day where the barefoot maiden raked her hay she wedded a man unlearned and poor and many children played round her door but care and sorrow and childbirth pain left their traces on heart and brain and oft when the summer sun shone hot on the new mown hay in the meadow lot and she heard the little spring brook fall over the roadside through the wall in the shade of the apple tree again she saw a rider draw his rein and gazing down with timid grace she felt his pleased eyes read her face sometimes her narrow kitchen walls stretched away into stately halls the weary wheel to a spinnet turned the tallow candle an astral burned and for him who sat by the chimney lug dozing and grumbling o er pipe and mug a manly form at her side she saw and joy was duty and love was law then she took up her burden of life again saying only it might have been alas for maiden alas for judge for rich repiner and household drudge god pity them both and pity us all who vainly the dreams of youth recall for of all sad words of tongue or pen the saddest are these it might have been ah well

in my story oh i was telling you how we were looking for wintergreen berries twas one bright morning in may and the moss grown rocks were slippery with the rains of yesterday but i was cross that morning though the sun shone ever so bright and when sister found the most berries i was angry enough to fight and when she laughed at my pouting we were little things you know i clinched my little fist up tight and struck her the biggest blow i struck her i tell you i struck her and she fell right over below there there maggie i won t rave now you needn t hold me so she went right over i tell you down down to the depths below tis deep and dark and horrid there where the waters flow she fell right over moaning bessie oh bessie so sad that when i looked down affrighted it drove me mad mad only her golden hair streaming out on the rippling wave only her little hand reaching up for someone to save and she sank down in the darkness i never saw her again and this is a chaos of blackness and darkness and grief since then no more playing together down on the pebbly strand nor building our dolls stone castles with halls and parlors grand no more fishing with bent pins in the little brook s clear waves no more holding funerals o er dead canaries graves no more walking together to the log schoolhouse each morn no more vexing the master with putting his rules to scorn no more feeding of white lambs with milk from the foaming pail no more playing see saw over the fence of rail no more telling of stories after we ve gone to bed nor talking of ghosts and goblins till we fairly shiver with dread no more whispering fearfully and hugging each other tight when the shutters shake and the dogs howl in the middle of the night no more saying our father kneeling by mother s knee for maggie i struck sister and mother is dead you see maggie sister s an angel isn t she isn t it true for angels have golden tresses and eyes like sister s blue now my hair isn t golden my eyes aren t blue you see now tell me maggie if i were to die could they make an angel of me you say oh yes you think so well then when i come to die we ll play up there in god s garden we ll play there sister and i now maggie you needn t eye me because i m talking so queer because i m talking so strangely you needn t have the least fear somehow i m feeling to night maggie as i never felt before i m sure i m sure of it maggie i never shall rave any more maggie you know how these long years i ve heard her calling so sad bessie oh bessie so mournful it always drives me mad how the winter wind shrieks down the chimney bessie oh bessie oh oh how the south wind wails at the casement bessie oh bessie so low but most of all when the may days come back with the flowers and the sun how the night bird singing all lonely bessie oh bessie doth moan you know how it sets me raving for she moaned oh bessie just so that time i struck little sister on the may day long ago now maggie i ve something to tell you you know may day is here well this very morning at sunrise the robins chirped bessie so clear all day long the wee birds singing perched on the garden wall called bessie oh bessie so sweetly i couldn t feel sorry at all now maggie i ve something to tell you let me lean up to you close do you see how the sunset has flooded the heavens with yellow and rose do you see o er the gilded cloud mountains sister s golden hair streaming out do you see her little hand beckoning do you hear her little voice calling out bessie oh bessie so gladly bessie oh bessie come haste yes sister i m coming i m coming to play in god s garden at last ', '']\n",
